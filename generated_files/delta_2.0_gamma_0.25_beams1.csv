9793,"""As it becomes more difficult to defend Obama, the probability of a charge of racism approaches.""
""It is becoming well nigh impossible to deny the racist overtones of these protests.""
What, may you ask, is the strongest argument for this astounding claim?
""Many of the virtually all-white crowd on Saturday yearned for an earlier time with less government involvement in society.""
You read that correctly: the fact that this crowd was predominantly caucasian (by Winters&apos; account), proves that it must be racist. By Winters&apos; logic, the United States Senate must be ""racist"" - it is ""virtually all-white"", after all.
""But, that earlier time [of less government involvement in society] recalls, for many of us, the memory of states’ rights being enforced through dogs and water cannons.""
3)... the anti-tax marchers want a return to racial segregation.
That is Winters&apos; argument, in three easy steps.
Liberal Catholics will go ballistic when a conservative Catholic writer makes an absurd argument, and demand that fellow conservatives disown the maverick&apos;s argument. Because, on the whole, we strive to be reasonable and agreeable people, we typically do so. We can call one of our own out of bounds without feeling we&apos;ve eroded our common arguments. We can call crazy ""crazy"" because we try to avoid it. Winters seems to be reduced to just writing crazy.
Well, in similar fashion",", I&apos;d like to see some ""liberal"" Catholic writers take Winters to the woodshed for this one. People who don&apos;t like Obama don&apos;t like him because they are racist - really?! Is anyone typically sympathetic to Winters prepared to defend this claim of his? There are many more people in America who did not attend this march who are sympathetic to the concerns of those who did attend. Are all of them equally guilty of the racism Winters ascribes?
I&apos;ll be waiting for such logical reflection on these claims Winters has injected into the debate.
But frankly, until Winters himself retracts this stupidity, I&apos;ll feel free to disregard him completely.
After all, I shouldn&apos;t give my time to someone who writes for a racist magazine like America.
I mean, just look at the complexion of that magazine&apos;s editors.",522,322,200,81.57843112945557,92.53590607643127,"[[0.5176767706871033, 0.9371121525764465, 0.8194391131401062, 0.35433170199394226, 0.3722480535507202, 0.6407257318496704, 0.35491618514060974, 0.6725671887397766, 0.5420435070991516, 0.6852728128433228, 0.600355863571167, 0.42653435468673706, 0.7803732752799988, 0.370515912771225, 0.6193667054176331, 0.91844642162323, 0.9158633947372437, 0.36667558550834656, 0.8082195520401001, 0.7213392853736877, 0.5078637003898621, 0.3528554141521454, 0.35165244340896606, 0.351760596036911, 0.35176387429237366, 0.7123181819915771, 0.7924234867095947, 0.9119161367416382, 0.834033727645874, 0.35307949781417847, 0.8387624621391296, 0.654742956161499, 0.6124591827392578, 0.486889123916626, 0.9545798897743225, 0.8914640545845032, 0.4552096724510193, 0.8980895280838013, 0.9141191840171814, 0.35345029830932617, 0.3553747534751892, 0.4603044390678406, 0.3586793541908264, 0.686592698097229, 0.6513004302978516, 0.7346869707107544, 0.36281728744506836, 0.790109395980835, 0.832390546798706, 0.5744829773902893, 0.7889853119850159, 0.6473532915115356, 0.7628710269927979, 0.9268792867660522, 0.7982186079025269, 0.8099116086959839, 0.8970162868499756, 0.5221866965293884, 0.35740259289741516, 0.8520200252532959, 0.5799775123596191, 0.7041829228401184, 0.8761609196662903, 0.9391310214996338, 0.8977503180503845, 0.7683244347572327, 0.47796571254730225, 0.3568551242351532, 0.8468607664108276, 0.6977763175964355, 0.7960768342018127, 0.7826735973358154, 0.8411311507225037, 0.40456029772758484, 0.35163089632987976, 0.3516882061958313, 0.3515893518924713, 0.3515596389770508, 0.6166391372680664, 0.8202880024909973, 0.8254716396331787, 0.7940213680267334, 0.8345587253570557, 0.7707166075706482, 0.7932333946228027, 0.6638761758804321, 0.6223013997077942, 0.9260950684547424, 0.893969714641571, 0.9560959339141846, 0.5488943457603455, 0.6328862309455872, 0.7382716536521912, 0.3525699973106384, 0.9441572427749634, 0.8590949177742004, 0.5576871037483215, 0.9192827939987183, 0.35165467858314514, 0.9674863815307617, 0.3529513478279114, 0.8192523717880249, 0.682949423789978, 0.5259444117546082, 0.9289768934249878, 0.9206161499023438, 0.8995152711868286, 0.589539110660553, 0.9675015211105347, 0.984620213508606, 0.7979037761688232, 0.8131047487258911, 0.8263987302780151, 0.9814332127571106, 0.5260688066482544, 0.6253148317337036, 0.9050979614257812, 0.8915608525276184, 0.9279671907424927, 0.8722742199897766, 0.8594292402267456, 0.8014938235282898, 0.7606604695320129, 0.5384947657585144, 0.5156163573265076, 0.3732319176197052, 0.608790934085846, 0.7081736326217651, 0.9120948910713196, 0.9205999374389648, 0.6145346760749817, 0.7352954149246216, 0.6401065587997437, 0.39908483624458313, 0.45910075306892395, 0.9207037091255188, 0.7855332493782043, 0.8916999697685242, 0.9398336410522461, 0.8156713247299194, 0.898758590221405, 0.9429375529289246, 0.8205562829971313, 0.8906184434890747, 0.8835070729255676, 0.41606685519218445, 0.7636170387268066, 0.4759063720703125, 0.5105697512626648, 0.90793377161026, 0.7687945365905762, 0.5930802822113037, 0.8855828642845154, 0.9687895178794861, 0.7056646943092346, 0.8861919045448303, 0.7784057855606079, 0.626507043838501, 0.8208925724029541, 0.6198484897613525, 0.3803667724132538, 0.8416084051132202, 0.8668427467346191, 0.9265406131744385, 0.6977537870407104, 0.4008103609085083, 0.405615895986557, 0.649264931678772, 0.6598483920097351, 0.8438974022865295, 0.982781171798706, 0.42986178398132324, 0.7984538078308105, 0.8548687696456909, 0.586769700050354, 0.8650719523429871, 0.9349275827407837, 0.4966266453266144, 0.7127362489700317, 0.8935346007347107, 0.6794338226318359, 0.9518153667449951, 0.9663520455360413, 0.7462394833564758, 0.7523530125617981, 0.9076657891273499, 0.6638422012329102, 0.9486598968505859, 0.9560467004776001, 0.9441238641738892, 0.7091559171676636, 0.6413401961326599, 0.7674168944358826, 0.9161821007728577, 0.7882270216941833, 0.7085702419281006, 0.8902699947357178, 0.5449656844139099, 0.3553561866283417, 0.3517741858959198]]",", it is easy to see how Winters&apos; argument would be taken by those who want to return to a time when the federal government ruled society.

4) Just about every liberal writer or pundit is either a racist or a hypocrite.
This is the most amazing and willful ignorance of all. Winters could not be more wrong than he is. He is wrong about the fact that liberals are more racist than conservatives. He is wrong about the fact that liberals are more racist than conservatives. He is wrong about the fact that liberals are more racist than conservatives. He is wrong about the fact that liberals are more racist than conservatives. And he is wrong about the fact that liberals are more racist than conservatives.
But, Winters is not wrong",", the anti-tax marchers want to get back to racial segregation.
4) They don&apos;t want to get rid of taxes entirely.
And again, the anti-tax marchers want an end to ""taxes entirely"".
They want to get rid of some taxes, and then to get rid of some taxes because they don&apos;t like how the government is using tax money to fund a welfare state.Fri, 13 Feb 2015 11:47:37 - escalated from 0

Citation needed. The fact is that we get to choose what we spend OUR money on, and to whom we give OUR money. That is a choice. The argument that ""taxes ought to be abolished"" is a fallacy. The arguments have to do with what we spend OUR money on, and the quality of those funds.The rest of your quote is a sentence fragment.

3801,"With so many hoops to jump through to close transactions, falling home prices, and unrealistic sellers and buyers, today’s agents have to hustle harder than ever before. This doesn’t have to be the case. With the right systems and the right processes in place, you can work smarter rather than hustling harder.
Everyone has systems. The question is: Which systems support your business to thrive vs. which systems create a drag on your production? A system can be as simple as taking a different route to work each day to search for for-sale-by-owner homes, or as complex as doing all your business online.
The hallmarks of a strong system are that it is repeatable, it reduces time and effort, and it yields consistent results. If you’re interested in working smarter rather than hustling harder, here are five areas where you can begin to systematize your business.
If you’re like most agents, you have multiple phone numbers on your business card. It’s much easier for clients to contact you on a single phone number. One of the simplest solutions is to use Google Voice. Google Voice provides you with a single phone number that goes to every one of your phones in the order you specify.
Your clients can find you easily, no matter where you are. Google Voice also allows you to keep your cell phone and your home phone private. When you are in a situation where you cannot take a voice call, Google Voice can transcribe your message into an email or text message. Surprisingly, there is no charge for this service, and it works both in the U.S. and Canada.
An increasing number of companies and agents are electing to go paperless. Many associations already publish their various contracts in a digital format. You can download these forms to any type of computer. They may also be available in the ""cloud,"" using systems such as DocuSign. Digital signatures can be obtained either through the equivalent of a lock-and-key approach (think of your credit card number tied to a password) or with an actual digital signature. On the tablet PCs, your clients sign their documents with a light pen. On the iPad, they can sign using their finger with apps such as Zosh.
Another way to go paperless is to create a digital pre-list package. In addition to the various forms and documents required to close a transaction, you can include a sample 90-day marketing plan, a digital brochure of the seller’s property, plus a link to the single-property website that you create for your sellers. Going paperless is one of the most effective ways to save both time and gasoline costs.
Many agents struggle with the idea of starting and maintaining a blog. There’s a simple solution, and it’s right in the outbox of your email. If you’re like most agents, you haven’t cleaned your outbox recently. If this is the case, look back through your past emails. Every email where you answered a client question is a potential blog post.
A simple way to create great content for your blog is to answer client questions using your blog rather than your email. Post both the question and the answer in your blog. You can also post market updates plus upcoming neighborhood events.
If you enjoy taking photos or videos, post them on your blog or your Facebook business page. Since most blogging platforms allow you to schedule your posts at a later date, increase the effectiveness of your system by doing all of your posts at the same time each week. Plug in the time and date you want the post published and the blogging platform handles it automatically.
Your interactions on social media are another great area to systematize. For example, if you have 150 Facebook friends, take 10 minutes each day to either ""like"" or comment on something that five of your friends post. At the end of the month, you will have contacted all 150 of your friends at least once.
Another approach is to use a system such as HootSuite. When you come across an article, picture, blog post, or some other online material that you believe your friends or followers may like, you can click the ""Tweet this"" button and HootSuite automatically creates a Tweet and posts to Facebook as well.
You can send the Tweet as is or modify it. The process takes just a few seconds and allows you to provide your followers with great information with a minimal amount of effort.","
How much time do you spend entering notes you have taken at listing appointments, inspections or walkthroughs on your computer? The paid version of Evernote allows you to take notes on your smartphone, iPad or personal computer. Evernote then makes those notes available on all of your Evernote-enabled devices simultaneously.
Instead of wasting time transferring this information from a handwritten form into a digital format, Evernote eliminates having to enter data twice saving you tremendous amounts of time and effort.
Which systems are best for you? The real test is in finding a system and then developing the habit of working with it regularly. The more you work with a system, the more efficient your use of the system becomes.
If the increasingly fast pace of the real estate business is draining your energy, a systems approach may be exactly what you need to put you back in control.

Your email list is another area where you can systematize your business. If you are like most agents, your email address is one of the most important pieces of your business. Many of your clients still use their email address as their primary contact information. Use email as a way to keep in touch with your clients and to send them news, market updates, and other important events.
If you’re like most agents, you have a website. Many people don’t realize how important a website truly is to their business. A website is a great way to connect with clients and their friends and family, and it is a great way to build your brand. If you’re like most agents, you have a website, but you haven’t added it to your systems.
If you haven’t created a website, you’re missing out on a tremendous resource. A website is a great way to build your brand. If you still have"," Another advantage is that it is a lot more fun to interact on social media than on email, fax, or phone.
Social media is a great source of free advertising. Many people share your content on social media without charging you. You should be doing this anyway, simply by visiting other agents' social media profiles. You may find that they are doing something similar, and the marketing opportunity is right there on your dashboard.

1713,"The value of Saudi industrial exports reached SR162 billion by the end of 2012 compared to SR110 million in 1974, Director General of Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) Ali Al-Ayed said.
Addressing a GCC industrial event in Oman, Al-Ayed said Saudi industrial exports have achieved high growth rates averaging 20 percent per year in the period 1974-2012.
It was organized by the Omani Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) in coordination with the Riyadh-based GCC general secretariat.
The SIDF chief attributed the robust growth of the industrial exports to the availability of hydrocarbons at preferential prices in addition to the conclusion of international and regional trade agreements to this end.
Plastic and chemical products accounted for 77"," percent of the total industrial exports in that year, followed by food products at 8 percent, base metals (6 percent), and electric devices and equipment (2 percent), he told the conference.
He said the SIDF used to adopt a series of measures to boost industrial exports, including attraction of foreign investments which had an effective role in transferring experience and technical know-how.
SIDF has approved SR42.2 billion, or 38 percent of total loans, for the industrial projects, he said.
He also enumerated a series of challenges facing local industries, notably how to diversify production and export base for local industries, upgrade technical knowledge, minimize global competition on local products, and how to boost efficiency of export logistics services.
The SIDF chief explored a number of recommendations for the development of national exports, including creation of a national strategy to develop industrial exports, expansion of regional and international trade cooperation and spread of awareness among investors and officials on the importance of exports.",362,162,200,75.18214893341064,86.09359192848206,"[[0.4689258337020874, 0.387014240026474, 0.6064924597740173, 0.7424378991127014, 0.5582751631736755, 0.393719881772995, 0.7589994668960571, 0.5456289052963257, 0.6514891386032104, 0.7331351041793823, 0.8257554769515991, 0.35538119077682495, 0.9435674548149109, 0.6007369160652161, 0.7626035809516907, 0.9586239457130432, 0.4019313454627991, 0.6302854418754578, 0.957332968711853, 0.5331188440322876, 0.9533424973487854, 0.40503090620040894, 0.523783802986145, 0.9440812468528748, 0.7794139385223389, 0.45613065361976624, 0.8744716644287109, 0.3681044578552246, 0.48779115080833435, 0.4462026357650757, 0.799971878528595, 0.3587467670440674, 0.3676936626434326, 0.352252334356308, 0.7582157850265503, 0.741794228553772, 0.35382893681526184, 0.35179412364959717, 0.8747782707214355, 0.9237118363380432, 0.7090913653373718, 0.9448047876358032, 0.7114276885986328, 0.8564169406890869, 0.9302136898040771, 0.9745512008666992, 0.3621412515640259, 0.9191746115684509, 0.8720812201499939, 0.8922679424285889, 0.7770137190818787, 0.7989431619644165, 0.6980212926864624, 0.4558985233306885, 0.5522422194480896, 0.4645325541496277, 0.899043083190918, 0.7243595719337463, 0.8449473977088928, 0.5699877738952637, 0.8741092681884766, 0.5725155472755432, 0.9379794597625732, 0.9543103575706482, 0.3912499248981476, 0.6113294363021851, 0.8757324814796448, 0.4230019450187683, 0.4076221287250519, 0.9259231090545654, 0.6848647594451904, 0.40815576910972595, 0.38852912187576294, 0.3633415997028351, 0.40378808975219727, 0.9353197813034058, 0.5911644697189331, 0.3525739014148712, 0.38316670060157776, 0.9434450268745422, 0.5101128816604614, 0.4319540858268738, 0.4032347798347473, 0.8961066603660583, 0.8736894130706787, 0.5592038035392761, 0.8582601547241211, 0.953076958656311, 0.5400343537330627, 0.3634980618953705, 0.5326012969017029, 0.8443720936775208, 0.5594160556793213, 0.35354822874069214, 0.8921306133270264, 0.9741435050964355, 0.6047684550285339, 0.3551454544067383, 0.9127050042152405, 0.8021398186683655, 0.669647216796875, 0.8945798873901367, 0.5418499708175659, 0.4617750346660614, 0.8335204720497131, 0.8738991618156433, 0.752902090549469, 0.882112979888916, 0.8118290305137634, 0.4512016177177429, 0.917547345161438, 0.9161661863327026, 0.949873685836792, 0.5539551973342896, 0.5002220869064331, 0.8885380625724792, 0.714201033115387, 0.9436901807785034, 0.7118955254554749, 0.8355824947357178, 0.6854460835456848, 0.8338819742202759, 0.8393058180809021, 0.6185426712036133, 0.6043686866760254, 0.7422922849655151, 0.8278806209564209, 0.6148965358734131, 0.3928389549255371, 0.4981652796268463, 0.8290881514549255, 0.35673987865448, 0.3807987570762634, 0.35197004675865173, 0.7623293995857239, 0.7490676641464233, 0.3535463511943817, 0.3517453670501709, 0.7862856388092041, 0.8311098217964172, 0.6317885518074036, 0.9167834520339966, 0.9043643474578857, 0.9643837213516235, 0.38089776039123535, 0.85406094789505, 0.6884694695472717, 0.8203018307685852, 0.9471613168716431, 0.7410927414894104, 0.8956314921379089, 0.7470479011535645, 0.9659478664398193, 0.4281620979309082, 0.7957906723022461, 0.9671246409416199, 0.6502042412757874, 0.7759348750114441, 0.8791415095329285, 0.9238417148590088, 0.6771354675292969, 0.9332975745201111, 0.8652164936065674, 0.8421351909637451, 0.7140074968338013, 0.8911188244819641, 0.8234770894050598, 0.48334231972694397, 0.815660297870636, 0.9163362979888916, 0.6756497621536255, 0.41979527473449707, 0.808358907699585, 0.8468145728111267, 0.7213335037231445, 0.3533002436161041, 0.3517265021800995, 0.6985915899276733, 0.8678048849105835, 0.5690641403198242, 0.8797173500061035, 0.8976210355758667, 0.9337981939315796, 0.6382688283920288, 0.583611249923706, 0.5969362258911133, 0.6987228989601135, 0.9291420578956604, 0.9267306327819824, 0.8854011297225952, 0.6782225370407104, 0.9155759811401367, 0.8343240022659302, 0.7356008291244507, 0.971717357635498, 0.8356441259384155, 0.6857874393463135, 0.5090681314468384, 0.8427802920341492, 0.35706135630607605]]"," percent of the total exports of Saudi industrial products, he said.
Agricultural products, machinery, and spare parts accounted for the remaining 23 percent.
Earlier, the Director General of GOIC, Abdulaziz Al-Ateeq, said that the Sultanate has made great strides in attracting foreign investments to the industrial sector.
Under the Saudi-led GCC Industrial Investment Program (SIGI), the Sultanate has invested SR8 billion in industrial projects being carried out in various GCC countries.
He pointed out that the Sultanate hosted the GCC Industrial Investment Forum in 2015, while the GCC Industrial Investment Forum 2018 was held in Riyadh in April this year.
Al-Ateeq said that the GCC Industrial Investment Program has resulted in the establishment of some 13 industrial zones in the GCC countries and the creation of over 25,000 jobs.
The Sultanate has contributed the largest share of funds in the GCC industrial investment program at SR7.2 billion, he said.
"," percent of the Saudi industrial exports during the period, followed by petroleum products at 41 percent, chemicals at 16 percent and construction materials at 10 percent.
Al-Ayed said SIDF is working on expanding trade through the establishment of eight regional industrial zones (RIZs), which are located in Al-Hassan, Muscat, Khor Fakkan, Musandam, Madinah, Akha, and Dhahran, in addition to the SIDF Industrial Park in Riyadh.
The Saudi industrial parks aim to provide a conducive environment for production and export of Saudi products to the regional countries, he added.
Al-Ayed said SIDF is working on developing a network of industrial parks to ease industrial development, adding that the industrial parks have been designed to facilitate industrial production and export.
The Saudi director general also said SIDF is working on opening a research and innovation center to help industries expand their production capabilities and export products.

9232,"Although the case has not advanced to the point where he’s assigned it to prosecutors, Campbell said there was a good chance Cappleman, who is one of four top prosecutors in his office, could have been involved.
But Campbell said the conflict wouldn’t prevent other prosecutors at the office from prosecuting Latvala.
“There’s no conflict,” Campbell said.
Latvala, 66, was at the pinnacle of his power as Senate budget chairman until allegations of sexual harassment, first reported by Politico, surfaced in November.
The Senate initiated two investigations, including hiring retired Judge Ronald Swanson to serve as special master. On Dec. 19, Swanson found probable cause that Latvala had violated Senate misconduct rules and sexually harassed a legislative aide. Swanson also said that Latvala may have violated state corruption laws by seeking sexual intimacy with a lobbyist in exchange for legislative favors.
Investigators, led by the head of FDLE’s executive investigations team, Scott McInerney, have still not reached out to key players, including Latvala and the lobbyist, Laura McLeod, lawyers for both said Tuesday.
Around the time the harassment"," allegations surfaced, Latvala hired Chaires, a former Leon County sheriff’s deputy, according to Latvala’s attorney, Steven R. Andrews.
Chaires, who owns Warrior Security Contractors, did not turn up any listening devices, he said.
Andrews noted that the work was completed before any potential criminal charges had emerged. Chaires was paid the $645 — not even a full day’s work for a typical investigator — on Dec. 11, nine days before Latvala resigned.
Andrews said he was not aware that Chaires was married to the deputy assistant state attorney.
Criminal defense lawyers told the Times/Herald that Campbell did the right thing in removing Cappleman, who is also a candidate for judge, from a potential Latvala case.

1387,"Premera Blue Cross Cyberattack Exposed Millions Of Customer Records : All Tech Considered The health insurance provider has revealed that a cyberattack discovered in January may have made the medical and financial information of 11 million people vulnerable to thieves.
Another big health insurance company has revealed it has been the target of a massive cyberattack.
Premera Blue Cross says hackers may have taken up to 11 million customer records. Those records include credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, even information about medical problems. This news is just coming out but Premera issued a statement saying it discovered the breach on Jan. 29. That's about the same date that Anthem, another Blue Cross company, told the FBI that it was breached.
It's possible that Anthem put the word out and, given the timelines, the attacks were related — done by the same perpetrator. At least that's an educated guess from the cybersecurity company iSight Partners.
Premera also says the attack itself started in May of last year. But iSight found a suspicious domain called ""prennera.com,"" an address that may have been made to spoof Premera's official website. It was created in December 2013.
Either way, that's many, many months to steal people's data. NPR has reported previously on the black market for credit cards and health records. Will a bunch of for-sale signs go up there? Probably not this time — or at least that's according to sources who hang out in the underground.
Health care data can be more valuable than credit card information on the black market. But so far, sources say, the Anthem data hasn't shown up on the underground sites. And Premera may not either. It could be that the hackers are not run-of-the-mill criminals, but in it for cyber-espionage.
Yes, cyber-espionage. As in spies. It's possible that a nation-state actor is involved.
Both health care companies are huge providers with lots of government workers. So if someone wants intel on Defense Department employees — where they live, spouses' names, serious (or embarrassing) medical conditions, a breach is a way to stockpile that data and use it for blackmail later.
As iSight malware analyst Brian Bartholomew says: ""The sole purpose of espionage is to steal information, gain advantage. By publicizing, you're giving up the leverage you have.""
NPR has asked Premera and the FBI whether they are alerting other health care providers to watch out or providing details other companies might benefit from. Neither has immediately responded to our inquiry.
There's another group called the National Healthcare ISAC (Information-sharing"," and Analysis Center) that helps to share breach information. They say they've been in contact with private investigators at Mandiant as well as federal investigators handling the case. So far, the specific ways that Premera was attacked — like the IP addresses the attacks came from or the specific types of malware — have not been declassified and shared with other potential targets.
Director Deborah Kobza says in an email, ""It is only through coordinated sector and cross-sector cybersecurity information sharing, that we, as a nation, can move critical infrastructure cybersecurity protection from a reactive to proactive stance.""
But what is Premera doing to protect victims — the up to 11 million people who may be affected here? Premera says it is offering two years of free credit monitoring. It's the same kind of protection that retailers and financial institutions have given victims of credit card hacking. But if the point of this theft is altogether different, espionage, then identity monitoring doesn't really help in the end.",753,553,200,37.573657512664795,37.63527846336365,"[[0.6791290640830994, 0.8084438443183899, 0.35229963064193726, 0.9583233594894409, 0.6273150444030762, 0.8202488422393799, 0.5910612344741821, 0.6591594219207764, 0.590614914894104, 0.6020148396492004, 0.9454218149185181, 0.9318286776542664, 0.9070134162902832, 0.9466913938522339, 0.869134783744812, 0.7660725116729736, 0.5267208218574524, 0.8952208757400513, 0.8790296912193298, 0.9733074903488159, 0.9375735521316528, 0.933552086353302, 0.8888674974441528, 0.8138108849525452, 0.9265159964561462, 0.5053337216377258, 0.8668503761291504, 0.755432665348053, 0.40033984184265137, 0.5880318880081177, 0.6840490698814392, 0.8998696804046631, 0.9028161764144897, 0.9743506908416748, 0.4718434512615204, 0.6812560558319092, 0.3735995888710022, 0.5651857256889343, 0.7755452394485474, 0.6249068379402161, 0.5107448697090149, 0.3555309474468231, 0.3516443371772766, 0.35178813338279724, 0.3515258729457855, 0.35150331258773804, 0.3515019714832306, 0.3515356481075287, 0.35163286328315735, 0.3515183925628662, 0.35155704617500305, 0.3516078293323517, 0.35154861211776733, 0.3515164256095886, 0.3515017032623291, 0.35153332352638245, 0.3515397608280182, 0.35267841815948486]]"," and Analysis Center) that does that kind of thing.

3190,"China's central bank says fighting inflation will receive higher priority this year, raising the possibility of more rate hikes at a time when other major economies are trying to boost growth.
The announcement late Thursday follows repeated pledges by Beijing to cool inflation that jumped to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November. Communist leaders worry that sharp rises in living costs might trigger unrest.
""Stabilizing price levels will receive more prominent status,"" the People's Bank of China said in a report after an annual planning meeting. The bank said it will ""effectively manage liquidity and control financial conditions that might cause excessive price increases.""
Chinese stocks declined in early trading Friday after the announcement but the main index rebounded to positive territory by late morning.
The inflation surge highlights the contrast between China, which rebounded quickly from the global crisis and is trying to restore normal financial conditions, and the United States and struggling European economies.
Higher interest rates could further slow China's growth, possibly cutting its demand for factory machinery, industrial components, iron ore and other imports from the United States, Europe, Australia and its Asian neighbors.
China's rapid expansion slowed to"," 9.6 percent in the three months ending in September, down from 10.3 percent the previous quarter, though still the highest of any major economy. Analysts expect that to slow further this year as Beijing clamps down on credit and steers growth to a more sustainable level.
Analysts blame the price rises on the flood of bank lending that helped China ward off the global downturn. Inflation so far is limited mostly to food, but analysts say price pressures will spread unless Beijing raises interest rates further and tightens access to credit.
Inflation has been well above the government's target of 3 percent since late last year and some analysts expect it to rise further in December and January.
The central bank has raised interest rates twice in the past three months, most recently on Christmas Day. Many analysts expect more increases this year.

That's the weakest expansion since the 2008 global financial crisis and signals a weakening of domestic consumer demand and a cooling of investment activity.
""We expect that the PBOC will maintain a proactive monetary policy stance and is likely to maintain reasonable monetary policy conditions"" in 2017, said Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING.
The central bank will continue to increase lending rates to support economic growth, but it won't raise rates as much as the government would like, Pang said.
The PBOC said Thursday that it will conduct an analysis of the market effect of its 2 percent lending rate cut in November. It has said it will cut rates as much as the government wants to spur economic growth and avoid inflation.
The bank also said it will look into raising a reserve ratio for commercial banks, which plays a role in how much cash they must hold for lending.
The"," 7.5 percent last year, the weakest pace in 28 years and down from a 2017 growth rate of more than 6 percent. And inflation, a leading policy concern, has been rising steadily.
China's consumer price increase has been slower than in many major economies because of relatively low interest rates.
The central bank said it will cut the amount of money it lends to lenders by at least 25 basis points to cool credit growth, and regulators will have more power to rein in inflationary forces. The move suggested Beijing might consider further rate increases.
That would be in contrast to recent comments by the government, which is trying to reduce debt levels while boosting growth to meet a long-term target. Some economists expect the People's Bank of China to raise short-term interest rates by at least 25 basis points starting in a move sometime in December.

5360,"JUST a month after coming into power, the Zifa board have been rocked by a tsunami with vice-president Gift Banda being suspended yesterday following a meeting of the game's leaders held in the capital.
The Bulawayo-based football administrator, who was a runaway winner in the battle for the Zifa vice-presidency, was suspended for allegedly reshuffling the Warriors technical team without the blessing of his boss, Felton Kamambo, and other board members.
Banda, who was Zifa acting president when he announced that Rahman Gumbo and Lloyd Mutasa had been relieved of their duties and replaced by Bongani Mafu and Tonderai Ndiraya, was said to have acted beyond the jurisdiction of his authority.
In arguments presented to his fellow board members yesterday, Banda said he felt his role as the acting president empowered him to make such decisions.
He even suggested that if what he did was out of line with the constitution, then the board had the power to reverse the appointments and stick with the old Warriors technical set-up.
Kamambo was out of the country in Senegal for the Caf awards at the time.
The appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu had to be ratified at the Zifa board meeting which was held yesterday but things quickly took a nasty turn when Banda was asked to leave the room while other board members discussed the issue. While the board could have merely chosen not to ratify the appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu, if they felt they had not been done according to their constitution, they decided that punitive measures should be meted on the Zifa vice-president.
The matter was taken to a vote and four of the seven remaining members voted for Banda to be suspended, pending the confirmation of his suspension by the Zifa Council at the association's annual meeting in March, while three voted for him to be retained as the vice-president.
Ironically, Banda, who received 35 votes from Councillors in a strong showing in his successful battle to become the Zifa vice-president just a month ago, had"," his fate sealed by just four votes from his fellow board members.
Interestingly, a margin of one vote was all that mattered for him to be suspended from his post and he becomes the first Zifa vice-president to meet such a fate since Kenny Marange was also kicked out of the board by the leadership of Cuthbert Dube eight years ago.
It's the first time that a Zifa vice-president, the second most powerful man in the management of the game in the country, has been booted out after just one month.
Zifa boss Kamambo had, interestingly, told the domestic football family that his leadership will not suspend any of the board members because he felt such a system crippled the operations of the leadership of the game. However, things changed dramatically yesterday when Banda was shown the red card by his fellow board members just one month after coming into office.
Banda refused to comment on the developments yesterday saying he will release a comprehensive response in due course.",633,433,200,10.949838161468506,97.13223218917847,"[[0.9525302648544312, 0.8385758399963379, 0.8950392007827759, 0.7731603384017944, 0.972461462020874, 0.8794018030166626, 0.7030295133590698, 0.5147686004638672, 0.8501180410385132, 0.8666833639144897, 0.3571874797344208, 0.7389116287231445, 0.863556981086731, 0.9805976748466492, 0.8827831149101257, 0.3779541552066803, 0.6171968579292297, 0.7016171216964722, 0.6184792518615723, 0.6437406539916992, 0.4464995861053467, 0.8951140642166138, 0.9226980209350586, 0.35705646872520447, 0.7988936305046082, 0.8891370296478271, 0.8046863079071045, 0.8532863259315491, 0.9052398204803467, 0.9649299383163452, 0.5280657410621643, 0.7013119459152222, 0.35506102442741394, 0.8468018770217896, 0.4137612581253052, 0.6709027290344238, 0.9317198395729065, 0.8169167041778564, 0.9022864103317261, 0.3767636716365814, 0.6162462830543518, 0.5183383822441101, 0.4137707054615021, 0.9001660346984863, 0.8733618855476379, 0.5463739633560181, 0.38173016905784607, 0.8499304056167603, 0.3528784215450287, 0.7443346977233887, 0.8496741056442261, 0.8071384429931641, 0.49504244327545166, 0.6058658957481384, 0.7309932708740234, 0.7287377119064331, 0.5214584469795227, 0.9131364226341248, 0.9231048822402954, 0.3569778501987457, 0.813050389289856, 0.9115296006202698, 0.872646689414978, 0.41008853912353516, 0.603182315826416, 0.8277755975723267, 0.6518231630325317, 0.8212623000144958, 0.388049453496933, 0.9343000054359436, 0.6997873783111572, 0.7940061092376709, 0.919488787651062, 0.5225117802619934, 0.35414913296699524, 0.9459165334701538, 0.5845794081687927, 0.7144778966903687, 0.5414379239082336, 0.520574688911438, 0.5863044261932373, 0.35152769088745117, 0.4314247965812683, 0.5841551423072815, 0.5101763010025024, 0.8829867839813232, 0.8066840171813965, 0.35664817690849304, 0.3519577383995056, 0.5980128049850464, 0.5793562531471252, 0.8451349139213562, 0.828583300113678, 0.9642276763916016, 0.7103480100631714, 0.6933521032333374, 0.7636345028877258, 0.5323644280433655, 0.7283565402030945, 0.5578809976577759, 0.744953453540802, 0.787769079208374, 0.37975627183914185, 0.7826656699180603, 0.7519890069961548, 0.7273027896881104, 0.7217670679092407, 0.7001727223396301, 0.35305914282798767, 0.6059027314186096, 0.7012739181518555, 0.5402316451072693, 0.918444037437439, 0.924445390701294, 0.35865622758865356, 0.7819961905479431, 0.856286346912384, 0.880134105682373, 0.9459331631660461, 0.9577143788337708, 0.7904836535453796, 0.873910129070282, 0.36818018555641174, 0.8072289824485779, 0.7139348387718201, 0.8719496726989746, 0.6199894547462463, 0.35446611046791077, 0.7270709276199341, 0.6343320608139038, 0.8834190964698792, 0.3533025085926056, 0.7986435890197754, 0.7836686372756958, 0.8900792002677917, 0.8083510398864746, 0.5705903172492981, 0.8999346494674683, 0.9135226011276245, 0.7815207839012146, 0.9548038244247437, 0.7868448495864868, 0.35554060339927673, 0.8607785701751709, 0.4968545436859131, 0.6725874543190002, 0.9643543362617493, 0.798940896987915, 0.4383137822151184, 0.7376025915145874, 0.9917587637901306, 0.8652154207229614, 0.943488597869873, 0.41847527027130127, 0.41451385617256165, 0.9449703097343445, 0.9584299921989441, 0.8491671681404114, 0.5007315278053284, 0.7101223468780518, 0.8195315599441528, 0.7934436798095703, 0.5724878907203674, 0.8375524878501892, 0.9174693822860718, 0.4408932030200958, 0.4769296646118164, 0.7704167366027832, 0.35748767852783203, 0.8927026987075806, 0.8907503485679626, 0.9252892732620239, 0.3686314821243286, 0.9153199791908264, 0.8388627171516418, 0.9876566529273987, 0.5343002080917358, 0.5617258548736572, 0.3527565896511078, 0.3517349362373352, 0.8852112889289856, 0.47711917757987976, 0.3558756709098816, 0.4977422058582306, 0.9303306341171265, 0.9554147124290466, 0.9636530876159668, 0.6439723372459412, 0.48026105761528015, 0.4993704557418823, 0.8582785129547119, 0.364393025636673, 0.7705126404762268, 0.49702122807502747, 0.6556060314178467, 0.9171202182769775, 0.3568607270717621, 0.9422541260719299, 0.7462642192840576, 0.8072667121887207]]", toLuveve," taken a stance of acting against what he called Zifa's ""disregard of the constitution"".
The Zifa council, which is a meeting of Zifa board members and is not open to the public, has the authority to ratify any decision by a board member.
The Zifa council is set to meet at a Zifa office today and is likely to take a final decision on Banda's fate, while Ndiraya — who has been nominated as the new Warriors coach — is set to take over as acting Zifa president.
The Zifa council yesterday also appointed three other board members who will represent Zifa at the CAF Congress in Senegal.

1180,"TLC member says she'll stream Supernova on Web site to meet self-imposed deadline.
To quote Sunshine Anderson, we've ""heard it all before.""
After years of talk and no delivery, nobody should be surprised that Arista has announced it will push back the in-store date for Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes' solo debut, Supernova, from summer to fall.
However, the self-proclaimed ""crazy"" of TLC said she'll have her music out to the people on August 16 by hook or by crook.
""I picked the 16th as the release date because something weird happened in my family,"" she explained. ""My father died and his father was born on August 16. And January 31 was the day that he was born and his father died. So they came in and out on each other's dates, and they were both 40 when they died.""
Left Eye is so adamant about the album coming out next week that she said she'll stream the album's 13 tracks on her Web site (www.eyenetics.com) starting at 12:01 a.m. on that fateful day. She's getting support from the label online; an Arista spokesperson said the tracks will also be streamed on parent company BMG's click2music.com.
""It's a very significant release date for me,"" Left Eye said. ""It was something that has been sitting in the back of my mind for a couple of years now like, 'Wow, I wonder what that means?' There's magic in those numbers for me, because 162001 equals 10, which in numerology is symbolic of a star, and the album is called Supernova. It all ties in. It's a conceptual thing but there's a deep meaning buried in it. Everything has a double meaning.""
A fair share of stars guest on the album. Look for appearances by Carl Thomas, Esthero, Blaque and Tupac Shakur.
""The track with Tupac is titled 'Untouchable,' and it speaks for itself,"" Left Eye said. ""Tupac and everything about him is untouchable to me. I didn't record the song with him. I got a copy of the song and his lyrics were on the track. If you want to talk about whether I recorded it before or after his death, I can't answer that. It's still a mystery to me.""
Left Eye said she asks about the mysteries of life, and the mysteries of Pac's life, on the track.
""I'm basically asking him to answer those questions for me,"" she said. ""In the third verse he gives me his view from the other side. Some of the song's lyrics are so heavy. He says things like, 'You remember me legendary, I live eternally.' He produced the song. It's dynamite to me because he isn't"," known as a producer. It's like a double whammy because I get a song produced by Tupac  a song featuring him that actually features me. I'm featured on a Tupac song on my album.""
As to why Arista has decided to push back the album's release after confirming it would be out on August 14 a month ago (see ""Left Eye Delivering Solo Supernova... Finally""), a label spokesperson said Arista wanted Left Eye to record more tracks for the album as well as lay vocals for the new TLC disc.

The album is also a nod to the late Tupac, who was born on August 16, 1981.
""Tupac is like the ultimate brother,"" Left Eye said. ""I love to talk about him, and I love to listen to his music, and I love to see his face. He's just a legend, and he's one of my heroes. I always think about him, and I always have a 'Pac' tattoo on my arm. It's a tattoo of him saying, 'I'm the greatest.' I find that very powerful. I wanted to do something with him.""
Left Eye's most recent TLC single, ""The Rap,"" recently reached the Top 10 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart.
""I'm very proud of it,"" Left Eye said. ""The song got a lot of play, and I think it's a good song. I'm ecstatic about"," just a Tupac song. It's a Tupac song with a little bit of a bluesy edge, just like his music is supposed to be.""
""I knew if he was going to be on the album, I wanted to do it with him,"" she said. ""We're still working on the track. We're still working on a lot of songs.""
Despite all the speculation and the lack of information, Left Eye said she couldn't be happier to get to work on this album and get it out into the world.
""When it came time to record it, it was the only thing I was looking at. It was just too important to miss. I can't wait,"" she said. ""I was so bummed when I found out that it was pushed back. I'm just super stoked to be working on it.""
Left Eye plans to tour the album around the country — and to her fans.

2417,"In a 53-page document filed quietly last week with environmental regulators and made public Tuesday, sweeping changes are detailed in the state’s highway tolling infrastructure and policies – including a program to charge tolls on the Tobin Bridge for northbound and southbound traffic.
The document – published in the insider-only ‘Environmental Monitor’ – details the new All-Electronic Tolling System (AETS) implementation project, a project addressed in some measure through meetings held in Chelsea and other municipalities earlier this summer. It’s a project Gov. Deval Patrick has pushed since day one, eliminating cash toll collection booths and going to an all-electronic system. It would be the largest toll road electronic conversion project in the nation to date, if approved.
While the document made public this week is concerned mostly with environmental aspects of the project, many key details in the tolling plan emerged concerning the Tobin Bridge and harbor tunnels (Ted Williams, Callahan, Sumner and I-90 Boston Extension).
One of the major changes for the Tobin and harbor tunnels includes adding tolling locations for northbound traffic. Currently, all northbound traffic out of Boston on the Bridge and tunnels pays no toll. Under the new plan, AETS gateways would be added for northbound and southbound traffic – meaning that a person going into Boston from Chelsea or other points north would be charged going in and coming out.
There was no word in the document about whether Chelsea’s host community discount would continue for the Bridge, which would be a key question for those living in Chelsea. That said, state transportation officials have certainly had their sights set on eliminating such discounts systemwide for the last several years. That, however, will be a conversation for a different day and likely something that local leaders will have to fight for.
The toll booths on the Tobin would be demolished under the plan, and new AETS gateways would be stretched over the southbound roadway after the Bridge and just before the exit splits (Rutherford Ave. or 93 South) in Charlestown.
Later, a northbound tolling gateway is proposed to stretch across the northbound roadway just prior to the entrance to the Bridge tunnel, also in Charlestown.
The southbound Tobin AETS gateway would actually end up being the Pilot Program for the new technology – being implemented next year as a test for the systemwide change that is proposed for 2015.
The system would work via the EZ Pass electronic collection method that many already use. Statistics in the filing showed that 68 percent of tolls at the Bridge and harbor tunnels in 2012 were collected via the EZ Pass. For those who do not or cannot convert to the EZ Pass system, photos of a person’s license plate will be taken at each toll gateway and an invoice will be sent on a monthly basis to the owner of that plate. The state has already worked out a system of enforcement with other states to collect unpaid tolls from out-of-state placeholders. Similarly, those in-state placeholders who do not pay the invoices would be subject to fines and Registry withholdings.
For those in Chelsea who use the Ted Williams Tunnel or the Callahan Tunnel, there would be a major change and with no possible savings via the host discount. The northbound Callahan Tunnel and the northbound side of the Ted Williams Tunnel also will begin charging a toll – a movement that is now free as tolls are only charged for those coming into Boston.
“The Metropolitan Highway System (MHS) Williams Tunnel currently collects tolls in two nearby westbound (inbound) plazas by Logan Airport,” read the filing. “These structures will be retained, but cash collection booths and equipment will be removed. Also, this tunnel will be converted from one-way to two-way tolling, with the addition of an AETS toll zone for eastbound traffic. Rates will be modified to reflect the change in tolls by collection in both directions.
While the filing indicated modified rates for only the Williams Tunnel due to two-way tolling, it did not specify what kind of rate modification, and it mentioned no rate modifications for two-way tolling at the Tobin Bridge and Sumner/Callahan crossings.
All in"," all, 18 new gated toll locations would be added to the system to accompany the existing 24 locations.
While most of the locations are in Western and Central Massachusetts on the Mass Pike and are designed to reduce traffic congestion and the “ticket” toll system, the moves on the Boston Pike Extension and the Bridge/Harbor Tunnels would be huge changes.
Many local and state officials had no idea of the dramatic changes detailed in the filing until told by the newspaper, and all deferred comment until they could find out more information on the extensive plan.
Key members in the Legislature, however, tended to think the DOT was taking the half-a-loaf approach – asking for the full loaf in hopes of getting a half-loaf or even just a slice of bread.
Such changes can be implemented without Legislative approval – requiring only that Commissioners approve it. However, such a change would cost millions and that kind of appropriation would need to be approved by the State Legislature.",1086,886,200,105.77514147758484,65.8188488483429,"[[0.4400375485420227, 0.37522268295288086, 0.6565824747085571, 0.9155356287956238, 0.9618709087371826, 0.811077892780304, 0.9621673226356506, 0.8688844442367554, 0.8084228038787842, 0.7214294672012329, 0.9544673562049866, 0.8824729919433594, 0.9297323226928711, 0.8311892151832581, 0.858900249004364, 0.5261285305023193, 0.8541450500488281, 0.7419779300689697, 0.7985647916793823, 0.8162479996681213, 0.4620361328125, 0.6583639979362488, 0.8591060638427734, 0.7529361844062805, 0.8511151671409607, 0.7667499780654907, 0.35368624329566956, 0.8502677083015442, 0.9689491987228394, 0.9045186042785645, 0.7033399343490601, 0.884155809879303, 0.6931437253952026, 0.8211554884910583, 0.6591693758964539, 0.8553464412689209, 0.6124646067619324, 0.5708848834037781, 0.5317683219909668, 0.3520496189594269, 0.3590483069419861, 0.5958462357521057, 0.599724292755127, 0.3623182773590088, 0.353022038936615, 0.45251163840293884, 0.6847892999649048, 0.8480385541915894, 0.6145051717758179, 0.4817143380641937, 0.8236750960350037, 0.4156806468963623, 0.9327218532562256, 0.7074826955795288, 0.6814311742782593, 0.6124184131622314, 0.7646145224571228, 0.8414538502693176, 0.6425248980522156, 0.5064412355422974, 0.77176833152771, 0.9562182426452637, 0.8712760210037231, 0.9545028209686279, 0.9156711101531982, 0.5864189863204956, 0.35761716961860657, 0.742652952671051, 0.8887112140655518, 0.937494158744812, 0.7098297476768494, 0.8997325897216797, 0.9633866548538208, 0.8712918758392334, 0.9059067964553833, 0.845249593257904, 0.5695130825042725, 0.9166018962860107, 0.7362844944000244, 0.4262842535972595, 0.5542846322059631, 0.8778809309005737, 0.642801821231842, 0.6512065529823303, 0.6100183129310608, 0.4963424503803253, 0.7681562304496765, 0.9663476943969727, 0.8826354146003723, 0.8484746217727661, 0.8983303904533386, 0.5287339091300964, 0.5262369513511658, 0.36894696950912476, 0.49483850598335266, 0.6205573081970215]]"," all, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) has listed some major changes to the tolling plan.
The plan for the Tobin Bridge and harbor tunnels also includes a new change from the “Transfer of Charge” system that is currently used to collect tolls on the bridge, to a “System of Collection.” The “Transfer of Charge” program was put in place in 2002, and it requires the tolling authority to pay tolls to the state Transportation Authority (TAA).
Under the new system, the new system of collection would have the authority pay the tolling authority for the bridge and harbor tunnels in October and November, and then pay the TAA for the tolling in January and February.
“The new system of collection will result in a net savings to the toll authority of approximately $9.6 million annually,” read the filing.

7860,"Chattanooga Railway. In a city famous for its ``choo choos,'' the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is billed as the world's steepest. Back in the 1880s, a group of Chattanooga businessmen built an elaborate hotel just below a famous point on Lookout Mountain. To convey guests to the hotel, they built a narrow-guage railway up the side of the mountain. Today the hotel is long gone, but the railway remains, and it gives passengers the chance to see one of Tennessee's most impressive views.

Nearly 2,000 Americans were turned away at French borders this year for not having visas. To enter France, you must get a visa - a stamp in your passport showing it has been examined by the proper officals of that country - before you go. You'll need a valid passport, $15, one passport-sized photo of yourself, and an application form completed and signed. Visas are issued on the spot if you apply in person; by mail it takes up to three weeks. A visa is valid for three years and permits you to stay up to 90 days at a time. For application and instructions, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the French Consulate in your region or to the French Embassy, 4101 Reservoir Rd. N.W., Washington, DC 20007.
Memorize your passport number. You'll need it when you cash a traveler's check, fill out a customs form, or register at a hotel.
Take a sweater. Even if you're traveling in a tropical hot spot, an air-conditioned bus or restaurant may be uncomfortably chilly.
Don't automatically change your dollars to local currency. Many cities will take those dollars, and it saves constant switching back and forth to new money.
Take an umbrella. Hopefully it won't rain. If you're touring by bus, rack it there.
Use a camera that offers control over flash. You'll get more pictures. Often it's the flash, not the picture taking, that's objectionable.
Coordinate your watch with your guide's. If you don't, and your watch is slow, you may get left behind.

3185,"The third season of Sons of Anarchy saw the motorcycle gang travel to Ireland and back, and ended with many of them going to prison. But while Jax (Charlie Hunnam) and Clay (Ron Perlman) patch up their relationship in jail, Tara finds out that Jax's deceased father and former leader of the motorcycle club feared that he would be killed by Clay and Gemma. We asked SOA creator Kurt Sutter about where he wants to take the fourth season, and when viewers can expect the crap to hit the fan.
TV Guide Magazine: What was the feedback you got for the third season?
Sutter: It's been primarily good. It's always a risk when you take your guys out of their main environment and I think when we went to Ireland people started wondering what that was about, but I think once we started to reveal the mythology about why we were going to Ireland and the weight of that on Jax. I saw that one of the sites was picking their favorite season and oddly enough Season 3 was up by three or four percent over season 2. So overall I think there was something fascinating about the scope of it, and going out of their environment. I love revealing the mythology, I love the whole IRA connection and the thematic weight of that. I'm a history guy, so there's a part of me that was digging on that.
TV Guide Magazine: Where do you see the fourth season going? Do you see more focus being placed on what happened to John?
Sutter: I think that always looms out there for Jax and I think the information he got this season will continue to impact him. But I think Season 4 will really be about dealing with the ramifications of all that new information, and it's a different Charming that they're coming back to. It's a different gun business for them. The 21st Century really starts to creep into the town and into the club.
TV Guide Magazine: What does that mean, specifically?
Sutter: I think ultimately there's a lot more progress in the town with Hale now becoming mayor there'll be a lot more development in the town. All the things they've been trying to avoid for years will ultimately start to creep in. If they can't keep Charming contained anymore, how do they deal with that?
TV Guide Magazine: Are you tempted to make it more about Clay and Jax and Gemma?
Sutter: I think ultimately, it is about the three of them and everything sort of is either background or devices to complicate all those relationships. I think Clay has a personal connection with Charming and there's something about the karmic weight of if he can keep that"," town small and safe, everything else we do is OK. So I think it's important for Clay to maintain that relationship with Charming. So it will be interesting to see how he deals with that this season.
TV Guide Magazine: I assume there will be another confrontation between Clay and Jax at some point.
Sutter: At some point. I think it's interesting that we opened those wounds up in Season 2 and then let them heal over in Season 3. I think one of the most powerful moments of the season for people was in the finale when Clay says to jax, 'I love you, son.' In contrast to what was going on last season, and I think there's almost a greater sense of betrayal when those wounds heal over and you ultimately rip the scab off again.

TV Guide Magazine: You've said that Jax is a great husband and father, but he's also an enigma. He's very hard to understand and appreciate, so do you want to explore some of the darker aspects of Jax?
Sutter: I think there's a lot of questions on that. I think there's a lot of things that need to be explored that have to do with him and the way he sees the world. What is it that makes him a good man, and what is it that makes him a bad man? Is it because he's a bad man? Or is it because he's a good man? I don't think we're ever going to be able to answer"," alive, and the impact of what that is on Gemma and Jax. But ultimately, it's the trio and the three of them together, and it's the whole gang-up. I think they're a big part of how to get to that moment and how to get to that dynamic moment.
TV Guide Magazine: Are there any other storylines you're keeping your eye on for Season 4?
Sutter: Yeah, it's been interesting just in terms of how long we can keep these characters there, and how long we can keep these storylines going. I displacement the show, and it's been interesting to think about what it would be like to not have them there; how to get to that moment, and how to get to that dynamic moment. It's been interesting. I don't think we've ever taken a three year break in the sense of what we've been doing. But there are stories on the horizon.

7934,"NEWARK – Filling out his Winnipeg Jets lineup card has probably never been tougher for head coach Paul Maurice than it is right now.
That job only figures to become more challenging later this month with the expected return of defenceman Jacob Trouba and centre Adam Lowry from injury.
As the Jets get face to face the New York Rangers on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, Maurice isn’t planning to make any lineup changes after his team has posted consecutive victories to improve to 39-17-9 on the season.
Jets forward Brandon Tanev missed 10 consecutive games with an upper-body injury, but is expected to be a healthy scratch for the second contest in a row.
Just how does Maurice strike the balance between not wanting to change things up and finding room for a player that was an effective player for the Jets prior to the injury?
“That is a really good question and I’m working on that,” Maurice said after the Jets skated at the New Jersey Devils practice rink on Monday afternoon. “Fairly soon, if everything plays out, we’re going to have four extra healthy forwards that have all played for us.
Starting with training camp, the competition to both stay in the lineup and earn more ice time began in earnest.
But as injuries and opportunities occurred over the course of the season, youngsters like Kyle Connor and later Jack Roslovic have not just established themselves as regulars – they’re making an important contribution on the top two lines.
Connor is actually third on the Jets in goals (22) and sixth in points (41), which is even more impressive when you consider he started in the AHL and missed the first six games.
The addition of veteran centre Paul Stastny gave the Jets even more strength down the middle.
And after starting the campaign with what was basically a top-six and bottom-six forward group, the Jets have evolved into a team that features three scoring lines and a checking line, albeit one that can also chip in offensively.
Having that type of depth is a luxury the Jets haven’t really enjoyed during the six previous seasons.
It makes them a dangerous group to contend with and opposition coaches are being forced to make tough choices when it comes to which line to play the top defence pairing against.
Do you load up and try to contain Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler or do you send the shutdown group out against Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers?
And don’t forget about veterans like Little and Mathieu Perreault.
It essentially becomes a bit of a pick your poison situation.
Internal competition can be a driving force and bring out the best in players.
It can also make life difficult for those on the outside looking in – especially for guys who had been carving out a role like Tanev, as a penalty killer who uses his speed to create havoc on the forecheck.
The goal for every team is to win,"," but those clubs who are often the most successful find a way to make the necessary personal sacrifices while working hard enough to be ready whenever their number is called.
Winning often makes being a healthy scratch a bit more palatable, even though it’s never easy to accept.
“If you’re out of the lineup, obviously you want to be and be playing and be a part of it but for a team, it’s a good thing to have,” said Little. “The depth is so deep that you have good players out of your lineup and good players that are fighting for ice time and trying to get in. We can someone up and they’re NHL ready right off the bat and we’ve got guys fighting for spots in the lineup. We still have guys on the (Manitoba) Moose right now that aren’t even here that can probably step in pretty soon and be a player on this team.",814,614,200,93.53234004974365,104.50103712081909,"[[0.7093544006347656, 0.9137742519378662, 0.8422092795372009, 0.8854907155036926, 0.5993065237998962, 0.5874373316764832, 0.7477215528488159, 0.6946519613265991, 0.9049712419509888, 0.7091432213783264, 0.6774531006813049, 0.6488720178604126, 0.3703238368034363, 0.43430864810943604, 0.8299590945243835, 0.8992570042610168, 0.9307210445404053, 0.8328721523284912, 0.5413186550140381, 0.3789791762828827, 0.828271746635437, 0.6740570068359375, 0.7568457126617432, 0.8004056811332703, 0.5905889272689819, 0.8706464767456055, 0.9620822072029114, 0.4382140338420868, 0.9064688682556152, 0.7233332395553589, 0.7960470914840698, 0.8095355033874512, 0.380795955657959, 0.4282422959804535, 0.7826129794120789, 0.8853769302368164, 0.8611515760421753, 0.7718961238861084, 0.7313193082809448, 0.6789300441741943, 0.6935803890228271, 0.7920829653739929, 0.37195712327957153, 0.6349117755889893, 0.9207229614257812, 0.8730090856552124, 0.5089066028594971, 0.7689086198806763, 0.7226203083992004, 0.9221194982528687, 0.7271496057510376, 0.8276858925819397, 0.7917171716690063, 0.8233319520950317, 0.5779695510864258, 0.4572460651397705, 0.5611070394515991, 0.7034366726875305, 0.3538495898246765, 0.7808766961097717, 0.8027995824813843, 0.6223254203796387, 0.6104301810264587, 0.4141698479652405, 0.906556248664856, 0.793938398361206, 0.7743715643882751, 0.8101652264595032, 0.5243654847145081, 0.9031020998954773, 0.7596902847290039, 0.6368370056152344, 0.7385287880897522, 0.852025032043457, 0.6960884928703308, 0.5949680805206299, 0.5933403372764587, 0.8049901127815247, 0.44346511363983154, 0.8438096046447754, 0.3681616485118866, 0.35269972681999207, 0.9085077047348022, 0.9505360722541809, 0.7524181008338928, 0.7074397802352905, 0.35543838143348694, 0.7717441320419312, 0.9384542107582092, 0.7159389853477478, 0.7537716627120972, 0.9400361180305481, 0.8264630436897278, 0.380301296710968, 0.6406547427177429, 0.736484706401825, 0.709134042263031, 0.9617742896080017, 0.9342026114463806, 0.8597334623336792, 0.6790603995323181, 0.856303870677948, 0.3639872968196869, 0.3554246723651886, 0.6864016652107239, 0.9514056444168091, 0.7779953479766846, 0.6568323373794556, 0.8734706044197083, 0.8280067443847656, 0.85938960313797, 0.5768164396286011, 0.8743276596069336, 0.35152649879455566, 0.7105199098587036, 0.3617638945579529, 0.8178554177284241, 0.3814347982406616, 0.9065231084823608, 0.9427916407585144, 0.47377365827560425, 0.808818519115448, 0.8457111716270447, 0.9403023719787598, 0.35420969128608704, 0.9706764221191406, 0.6210248470306396, 0.35664212703704834, 0.9381392002105713, 0.8596282005310059, 0.4769448935985565, 0.4788765609264374, 0.43400365114212036, 0.7884693145751953, 0.9422512054443359, 0.9214019179344177, 0.3615020513534546, 0.965003252029419, 0.9491698741912842, 0.7065207958221436, 0.37402668595314026, 0.8742760419845581, 0.7843993902206421, 0.35167694091796875, 0.518900990486145, 0.8648350238800049, 0.5491708517074585, 0.3544328510761261, 0.9656826257705688, 0.9097968339920044, 0.7311394810676575, 0.8325636386871338, 0.8453189134597778, 0.8250389695167542, 0.7923429012298584, 0.8994872570037842, 0.9590869545936584, 0.8383210897445679, 0.6096334457397461, 0.7925947308540344, 0.8029096722602844, 0.779874324798584, 0.7431696653366089, 0.8439712524414062, 0.7113339900970459, 0.6189116835594177, 0.6324692964553833, 0.5539056062698364, 0.5912220478057861, 0.7396785020828247, 0.6310442686080933, 0.9188742637634277, 0.7421180009841919, 0.5754599571228027, 0.7726587653160095, 0.7113008499145508, 0.615045428276062, 0.8012391328811646, 0.7847286462783813, 0.474809855222702, 0.4588010013103485, 0.9334375262260437, 0.8503702282905579, 0.3642013967037201, 0.850383996963501, 0.8819573521614075, 0.819571316242218, 0.3528017997741699, 0.5847325325012207, 0.35655495524406433, 0.35250598192214966, 0.3714544177055359, 0.3573160171508789, 0.35393139719963074, 0.3527448773384094, 0.35159364342689514, 0.35466253757476807, 0.3778853416442871, 0.35291972756385803, 0.3516705334186554]]"," which is something Maurice has been preaching since the start of the season.
He isn’t going to change that philosophy now.
“We want to win every game,” Maurice said when asked about the Jets’ mindset. “And it doesn’t matter if the opponent is a Flyer, a Ranger or New Jersey. We’re going to go full bore in that regard.
“We had a little bit of a rough start to the year. We didn’t play as well as we thought we did. We had a stretch of a little bit of a rough stretch. We got a little bit of a break in the middle of the year. We had a stretch where we put it together and got back on track. But we want to be as good as we possibly can and we’re going to have to go down contents.”
The Jets have won six of their last seven games and are riding a"," but facing a Jets team of this quality at this stage of the season is a tough ask.
That may be why Maurice is trying to keep things as stable as possible and not have to make drastic changes.
But when healthy, there are simply no two forwards, defencemen and goalies that look alike.
That is more of a luxury to have than it is to have.
Maurice is doing a remarkable job of adapting to the current state of the game and has been doing a masterful job of keeping the Jets competitive despite not having Trouba and Lowry.
The coaching staff has been able to mix and match for long periods of time without a lot of noticeable effect.
They’ve been able to get by for a while, and the next two weeks should be an extremely big one for them if they are to remain in the mix for the playoff race.

9583,"The Bears already made one major move to strengthen the offensive line when they signed left tackle Jermon Bushrod. This will create competition at right tackle, as Gabe Carimi and J'Marcus Webb will each push to earn the starting job. But the Bears still need to think about guards, and that's one area they can address with the draft.
Chance Warmack from Alabama is one of the best options for the Bears out of the draft. As a 6-foot-2, 317-lb. guard, he could fill holes in the Bears' interior line. He is known as a"," powerful run blocker, which would make Matt Forte quite happy.
The National Football Post says he has a nasty edge to his game, which the Bears line has been lacking since Olin Kreutz left the team. Part of keeping the quarterback safe means punishing the defenders who dare lay a hand on him. Warmack has the game to make it happen.
And it's not a bad idea for the Bears to bring in young, fresh talent on the interior. Lance Louis is a free agent who is coming off an ACL tear, and he still may not return. Roberto Garza just turned 34, and Chris Spencer and James Brown aren't as reliable the Bears need them to be.
Plus, that name! Think of all the headlines we can come up with the name Chance Warmack. It's a great, great football name that would fit well on the back of a Bears jersey. If he's available when the Bears pick at 20, Warmack would make sense for Chicago.",321,121,200,73.57593655586243,84.45289444923401,"[[0.9439913630485535, 0.609014093875885, 0.8200449347496033, 0.9152615666389465, 0.8852883577346802, 0.5540993213653564, 0.4378587007522583, 0.8818051815032959, 0.9558686017990112, 0.869831919670105, 0.6825988292694092, 0.7673026323318481, 0.6448569297790527, 0.877952516078949, 0.7978195548057556, 0.8441571593284607, 0.8368550539016724, 0.9315596222877502, 0.6655781269073486, 0.9328172206878662, 0.5272670388221741, 0.7928037643432617, 0.7255346179008484, 0.47598010301589966, 0.6301590800285339, 0.7885212302207947, 0.3515796959400177, 0.8709179759025574, 0.8509289026260376, 0.965031087398529, 0.8103503584861755, 0.8785487413406372, 0.428652822971344, 0.9262297749519348, 0.3518317937850952, 0.6620667576789856, 0.6493011713027954, 0.6603772044181824, 0.5195375680923462, 0.7140296101570129, 0.8553851842880249, 0.8829041123390198, 0.7740273475646973, 0.9290109276771545, 0.7955811619758606, 0.7601353526115417, 0.47170254588127136, 0.4859263300895691, 0.35411274433135986, 0.49635639786720276, 0.7876717448234558, 0.8991607427597046, 0.8596911430358887, 0.9354450702667236, 0.8454896211624146, 0.7576135993003845, 0.9389516115188599, 0.8075975179672241, 0.8488287925720215, 0.7793158888816833, 0.4024377167224884, 0.6858375072479248, 0.7597966194152832, 0.7356501221656799, 0.9628925323486328, 0.8257350325584412, 0.7296047806739807, 0.6805896759033203, 0.9089893698692322, 0.8454469442367554, 0.6706659197807312, 0.7753735184669495, 0.8968263864517212, 0.8904132843017578, 0.6836947798728943, 0.6563210487365723, 0.6877341270446777, 0.5015426874160767, 0.8330628275871277, 0.9469316005706787, 0.693988025188446, 0.7137134075164795, 0.9059545993804932, 0.729284405708313, 0.8765679001808167, 0.7748894095420837, 0.8675441145896912, 0.7739031314849854, 0.7449454665184021, 0.7630223035812378, 0.8150309920310974, 0.5055795311927795, 0.9618722200393677, 0.35231447219848633, 0.762398362159729, 0.8988942503929138, 0.8957129716873169, 0.9111948609352112, 0.7360514402389526, 0.8329467177391052, 0.8427877426147461, 0.9258878231048584, 0.7455896139144897, 0.6730020046234131, 0.7678549289703369, 0.658405065536499, 0.37981370091438293, 0.5150193572044373, 0.9233419895172119, 0.35156702995300293, 0.8306816816329956, 0.8382512331008911, 0.9631791710853577, 0.7302826046943665, 0.7594456076622009, 0.8671401143074036, 0.8507523536682129, 0.7322678565979004, 0.4373849034309387, 0.7879016995429993, 0.5613061189651489, 0.7067850828170776, 0.3855005204677582, 0.4010925590991974, 0.6075548529624939, 0.7736725807189941, 0.8718204498291016, 0.7530301809310913, 0.843039870262146, 0.8196821808815002, 0.6517319679260254, 0.8501377701759338, 0.8738446235656738, 0.727302610874176, 0.815047562122345, 0.5930522084236145, 0.7092013955116272, 0.7006536722183228, 0.913688063621521, 0.9215519428253174, 0.6401654481887817, 0.9828240871429443, 0.5780911445617676, 0.3548043966293335, 0.7666113972663879, 0.6957987546920776, 0.6679993867874146, 0.6725622415542603, 0.509804904460907, 0.6941605806350708, 0.7952597737312317, 0.8352677822113037, 0.9159874320030212, 0.8740572929382324, 0.9265065789222717, 0.9500241279602051, 0.6495057940483093, 0.8424150943756104, 0.6370385885238647, 0.646686315536499, 0.6626787781715393, 0.4845772087574005, 0.57241290807724, 0.7428789138793945, 0.9317877888679504, 0.6001307368278503, 0.8161998391151428, 0.8230015635490417, 0.8158105611801147, 0.9331234693527222, 0.8761686086654663, 0.6995621919631958, 0.4008179008960724, 0.8445953130722046, 0.8001914620399475, 0.8517225384712219, 0.8032196760177612, 0.555345356464386, 0.7085646986961365, 0.7748808860778809, 0.717107892036438, 0.6371177434921265, 0.6735541820526123, 0.92124342918396, 0.35156700015068054, 0.796134352684021, 0.7286803722381592, 0.812761664390564, 0.6788859367370605, 0.6765235662460327, 0.8380299806594849, 0.8023779392242432, 0.6951935887336731, 0.8810921311378479, 0.640619695186615, 0.5833032727241516, 0.5554044842720032, 0.5772997140884399, 0.6876002550125122, 0.8456504344940186]]"," great run blocker and has a good pass protection grade (71.6) in his last two seasons. Warmack has also played at left tackle and left guard.
Warmack is the third offensive lineman to be selected in the first round, following Andy Levitre and Greg Robinson in 2013. He is the only one of those three that is a free agent.
The Bears are also hoping to improve their offensive line with the addition of veteran guard Kyle Long. Long, who signed a one-year deal with the Bears, will most likely compete with Adam Shaheen and Jermon Bushrod for the starting spot.
Long is a four-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro who spent his first five seasons in Chicago. He was originally drafted in the second round by the Rams in 2003 and played for them until 2011. Long played for the Bills, Chargers, Saints, Colts, Cardinals and Titans after his time in Chicago.
If the Bears are looking"," veterinarians' dream because of how he plays in the pocket, so he has the size to hold up in pass protection. Warmack is a bit more of a finesse pass blocker though, and could struggle to do that at the next level. He is a tough player to get down in pass protection, so his size would be a positive for him against physical linebackers and defensive tackles who are fast.
The Bears could also add a guard to compete with Bushrod, but they could do so without drafting a player at the position. Warmack is a player who could be available in the third round of the draft, and could provide depth at guard and tackle. The Bears could also consider bringing back Pat Elflein to compete at left guard, but the team is already competing with him for the starting job.
The Bears will have to evaluate a lot of players to fill out the roster before the draft. Warmack is a player who could help this team immediately after being drafted, and could",200,200,0.36787968277931216,0.42226447224617003,"{'num_tokens_scored': 189, 'num_green_tokens': 109, 'green_fraction': 0.5767195767195767, 'z_score': 10.373024981475458, 'p_value': 1.6447187589375588e-25, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  0.8165,  1.6667,  2.3094,  2.8402,  3.2998,  2.8368,  2.4495,

It’s been a busy six months for Municipal Affairs Minister Chuck Porter, who took over the helm of the department in early July 2018.
“Municipal Affairs is a busy spot. There is a lot going on,” he told the Valley Harvester in early January. Porter’s portfolio includes the Office of the Fire Marshal, as well as the Emergency Management Office (EMO).
“Being minister for the entire province and not just one area can take a bit to get your head around when you’re passionate about the issues happening at home in your own constituency, but the key is to treat everyone the same. There is a variety of challenges among the municipalities, but also a lot of similar challenges and they’re all trying to operate on their tax base,” he said.
Porter said he encourages collaboration among municipalities so they can get the most bang for their bucks, but is trying not to put too much pressure on them after facilitating the special legislation consolidating Windsor and West Hants. So far, no other unit has requested consolidation legislation, but Porter isn’t ruling anything out.
Some councillors across the region had expressed concerns over the other legislation Porter brought to the Nova Scotia legislature in the fall: Bill 58, which requires municipalities to share their planning with neighbouring units. That doesn’t equal needing their permission, said Porter.
While he’s not in a position to share what legislation is coming forward in the house of assembly’s spring session, Porter said priorities the department has include revamping the Municipal Government Act and looking at changes to the Capped Assessment Program (CAP), which establishes a ceiling on what the amounts residential property assessments can increase annually. “There’s been a lot of talk about the unfairness of it, so maybe there is a better formula,” said Porter.
Challenges have a greater chance of creating more opportunities, but going into a new year there are still some lingering, costly problems, such as the inter-municipal service agreement that created Valley Waste Resource Management. “I can’t really comment on it because it’s still before the courts, but I’m staying on the positive side that it will all work out,” said Porter.
Just before Christmas last year, Valley Waste Resource Management was cleared by the RCMP following a complaint from the County of Annapolis at the end of July.
“Valley Waste was never advised as to the nature of the complaint,” said communications manager Andrew Garrett in"," a statement. But Valley Waste Resource Management continues to be in a precarious financial position with more than $800,000 plus interest it says it is owed by the County of Annapolis for services between April 1 and Aug. 17, 2018. Valley Waste Resource Management still has control of its transfer station on Elliot Road, while the county appeals a decision from the judicial review concerning its expropriation that was handed down in late November.
County of Kings Mayor Peter Muttart said in an email the cost of the “break-up” has yet to be determined and arbitration the province offered to pay for is not an option if the other party does not agree to it. “The alternative to binding arbitration is expensive court procedures,” he said, adding that the appeal may not be heard until the spring.
In the meantime, remaining municipal partners will be reviewing the Valley Waste Resource Management 2019-2020 budget for cost savings to cover a 17 per cent increase to them.",744,544,200,90.50317764282227,101.42244935035706,"[[0.6297000050544739, 0.47480517625808716, 0.654098391532898, 0.6393565535545349, 0.8663166761398315, 0.8832229375839233, 0.7993640303611755, 0.6248341202735901, 0.7843102216720581, 0.873454213142395, 0.9618927836418152, 0.8611130714416504, 0.9241600036621094, 0.9458281993865967, 0.7879202365875244, 0.7890159487724304, 0.7822551131248474, 0.7746709585189819, 0.3768620789051056, 0.7859707474708557, 0.6053475141525269, 0.7706884145736694, 0.7417954206466675, 0.7021552324295044, 0.8809953927993774, 0.8924463987350464, 0.8740395307540894, 0.7556735277175903, 0.6593782901763916, 0.3693728446960449, 0.6093581318855286, 0.5655356645584106, 0.6398877501487732, 0.502388596534729, 0.6703356504440308, 0.8123572468757629, 0.8578869104385376, 0.35932445526123047, 0.7530474662780762, 0.8208189010620117, 0.36343908309936523, 0.6946125030517578, 0.7243322730064392, 0.5209219455718994, 0.8103445172309875, 0.5738334655761719, 0.78095543384552, 0.4620667099952698, 0.7217127680778503, 0.57948237657547, 0.884774386882782, 0.9382684826850891, 0.9106428027153015, 0.944512128829956, 0.9316806197166443, 0.840736985206604, 0.7049353718757629, 0.3542706370353699, 0.8880496621131897, 0.9721609354019165, 0.9618090391159058, 0.5567363500595093, 0.36692801117897034, 0.9033129811286926, 0.77803635597229, 0.6692326068878174, 0.35646316409111023, 0.4754472076892853, 0.6363170742988586, 0.7223272919654846, 0.7737503051757812, 0.7008733749389648, 0.8790742754936218, 0.741571307182312, 0.6620832085609436, 0.37991848587989807, 0.858571469783783, 0.6469390392303467, 0.6908338665962219, 0.7549760341644287, 0.8087934851646423, 0.8890116214752197, 0.9516457915306091, 0.8722963929176331, 0.8382314443588257, 0.9326088428497314, 0.890965461730957, 0.6144539713859558, 0.7936356067657471, 0.9336493015289307, 0.5631862878799438, 0.9794138669967651, 0.7235520482063293, 0.3585250675678253, 0.6179656386375427, 0.9465396404266357, 0.545470118522644, 0.8326800465583801, 0.8508931398391724, 0.8037588596343994, 0.5248479843139648, 0.8022410869598389, 0.6581951379776001, 0.7703585624694824, 0.8031178712844849, 0.552452802658081, 0.8528965711593628, 0.947949230670929, 0.5383849740028381, 0.5083315968513489, 0.9309132099151611, 0.8655357360839844, 0.8591228723526001, 0.3546823263168335, 0.6134117841720581, 0.9357059001922607, 0.7782354354858398, 0.596413791179657, 0.8021714687347412, 0.36213067173957825, 0.6716488599777222, 0.5337476134300232, 0.6651957631111145, 0.8839842081069946, 0.8476755023002625, 0.8328649997711182, 0.944202184677124, 0.3663399815559387, 0.9777417778968811, 0.9217365980148315, 0.6970235705375671, 0.35217756032943726, 0.7706825137138367, 0.7308021187782288, 0.6844239234924316, 0.3626849353313446, 0.3516027331352234, 0.35154783725738525, 0.9025291800498962, 0.5263382792472839, 0.5650767683982849, 0.8649523258209229, 0.8817670345306396, 0.8450406193733215, 0.7008063197135925, 0.9133350253105164, 0.6089113354682922, 0.619455873966217, 0.3528536260128021, 0.8783854246139526, 0.9872013330459595, 0.5070669054985046, 0.35156601667404175, 0.351582407951355, 0.9464697241783142, 0.9074030518531799, 0.6595722436904907, 0.7726558446884155, 0.8284726738929749, 0.81102454662323, 0.7816171050071716, 0.9601900577545166, 0.442462295293808, 0.6930878162384033, 0.9229844808578491, 0.9393921494483948, 0.901360273361206, 0.8101210594177246, 0.7466863393783569, 0.7128989696502686, 0.9015553593635559, 0.9556509256362915, 0.46162697672843933, 0.667692244052887, 0.8571757674217224, 0.7435699701309204, 0.4298689365386963, 0.37732335925102234, 0.5586108565330505, 0.5127460360527039, 0.9107245206832886, 0.8058273792266846, 0.805379331111908, 0.8252715468406677, 0.8923766613006592, 0.7388993501663208, 0.4256895184516907, 0.3532998263835907, 0.6678746342658997, 0.6082272529602051, 0.3582827150821686, 0.3515799641609192, 0.35156068205833435, 0.3678141236305237, 0.3615591824054718, 0.36767640709877014, 0.35257527232170105, 0.3585164248943329, 0.36944645643234253, 0.3536098301410675]]"," an email. “The company did not receive a call from the County of Annapolis regarding any matter related to the matter, and neither the company nor the County received any information from anyone regarding the complaint.”
The county says it received a call from an unidentified person on Nov. 27, 2017, asking how much the company was worth. It responded by stating it was worth $1.3 million, but the caller said he could get the company for $2.5 million.
“The County of Annapolis does not have any personal relationship with the company, and did not receive any information regarding the complaint,” Garrett said. “Valley Waste was Motorola’s most recent client. The County does not have any current contracts with Motorola.”
The province has a mandate to provide municipalities with adequate resources. “We’re working with municipalities to figure out how to get them the resources they need so they can get the projects done"," an email.
After the complaint, the RCMP and county authorities met to determine if Valley Waste violated any provincial laws. The investigation determined it did not violate any provincial laws, and Valley Waste was allowed to continue to provide its waste management services.
The province has been in the midst of a $25-million lawsuit between Valley Waste and the municipality over fees paid to Valley Waste by the municipality.
The province is also currently working on a plan to reimburse Valley Waste $19 million, plus interest and costs, for legal fees, court costs and legal fees related to the settlement of the Valley Waste lawsuit. The settlement is a “significant settlement” in the province’s perspective.
The province is also in the midst of the province’s own lawsuit against the province regarding a long-term tax increase. The Province is not commenting on this lawsuit at this time.

5556,"FOUR of Diamonds have defended Honey G after they lost out on their place on the X Factor last night – while the controversial rapper was saved.
The girl group insisted Honey – real name Anna Guildford – “deserved” her place in the music contest as she works so hard.
The band - made up of Caroline, Lauren, Yasmin and Sophia - have also jumped to the defence of mentor Louis Walsh, insisting they couldn’t wish for a more “caring” judge.
And asked about Honey G being kept in the competition, despite furious backlash from viewers, they told us: “We all love Honey G, she’s great and she works so hard. She deserves her place as much as anyone else in the competition now.
And it’s not just Honey they’re full of praise for, as despite claims there had been tension with mentor Louis, all four girls couldn’t gush about him more.
“Louis doesn’t get enough credit as a mentor, he is so lovely to work with and he’s so caring,” Lauren told us.
“We spend so much time with him, we have his number, we used to call and text him all the time… He really cares, and I don’t think many people see that side of him.
The girl group got off to a rocky start on the live shows, as they were brought in to replace Brooks Way at the last minute, as the"," duo quit amid assault allegations.
Four of Diamonds broke down in tears ahead of the performance on Saturday over negative comments they had received online, after they were saved over singer Gifty Louise.
The Sun exclusively revealed previously that the band had been formed in a workshop, after all four girls auditioned as solo artists.
And explaining exactly how it happened, Caroline revealed: “We had our producers audition, and interviewed as solo artists, then management company got involved which was separate from the show got in touch, and they put us together at a workshop, before we met the judges as a group.
While Ryan Lawrie and Emily Middlemas are more loved up than ever, Lauren admitted there’s no other romances in the house.
The girls also appeared on Lorraine today, and Yasmin said: ""We are so happy to have got this far.

Yasmin, who was the only member of the group that wasn’t based in the UK, insisted: “We didn’t know what to expect, we probably didn’t even expect to be in the competition, but we’re here now, and I feel like we’re all so proud of ourselves.
“I remember the first time we performed in front of Louis, I said to him: ‘Louis, you’re so nice, you’re so nice, how come I don’t have a boyfriend?”‘

But they quickly found a way to make up for their early demerits, and won the audience vote against the other boyband when they performed their song Love Me Again at the last minute.
They’ve been on the X Factor since the beginning and have already released four singles, and are now on the hunt to win the whole show - and a whopping £1m prize pot.
But they have come under fire from many viewers, saying the trio should have been sent home last night already - and that they should have been replaced by the other boyband, the Popstars.
The four of Diamonds told The Sun: “We really appreciate all the support and we’ve been doing well since we came in last week.
“We’re not getting anywhere without our fans, and the viewers have been supporting us in a big way by sending us their messages of support.

4410,"Churchville-Chili swimmers Tyler Regelsberger and Brandon Crist set sights on making an impact at states.
Churchville-Chili seniors Brandon Crist and Tyler Regelsberger are Section V’s dynamic duo, the Batman and Robin of Section V boys swimming.
Who’s who is up for debate.
They both wear goggles like Robin's mask, but have builds like Batman. “The Boy Wonder” would serve as a fitting nickname for either.
Regelsberger disagrees with Crist, showcasing a less diplomatic version of The Caped Crusader.
One thing is certain, the 2017 Democrat and Chronicle All-Greater Rochester boys swimming selections have put together “super” performances this season.
The dynamic duo, who are also second cousins, have a combined nine top-four times across seven individual events and are members of a pair of Saints’ top-six relay times.
Regelsberger has recorded a top-three or better performance in five individual events this season. His 100-yard freestyle (48.31) performance is second-best in Section V, while his 200 freestyle (1:46.51), 200 individual medley (2:00.82), 50 freestyle (22.08) and 100 breast stroke (1:01.87) times are No. 3.
For the 100 butterfly (54.65) and 500 freestyle (4:52.12), his performances are good for No. 9 and No. 6, respectively.
His 50, 100, 200 and 500 freestyle times are state-meet qualifiers.
Not to be outdone, Crist has four top-four individual performances, including a Section V-best performance in the 500 freestyle (4:34.79). He has the No. 2 time in the 200 freestyle (1:44.33) and the No. 4 time in the 100 freestyle (49.09) and 100 butterfly (53.72).
His 100 backstroke (57.02) is ninth-best in Section V, while his 50 freestyle (22.64) is top-10 and 200 individual medley (2:07.53) is good for No. 13.
His 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle and 100 butterfly times are good enough to qualify for states.
The pair also regularly participate in the Saints’ 200 and 400 freestyle relays, with the fifth-best sectional time in the 400 (3:28.06) and sixth-best time in the 200 freestyle (1:35.07).
As for whether Batman would better serve as a lead or anchor, Regelsberger sees himself as a “lead-the-charge” version of the Bat.
Crist’s Dark Knight is more of a “save-the-day” type.
Except for Crist’s 500 freestyle, there are more than a number of second-bests and third-bests. Enter Pittsford",", whose program and individual dominance in the pool provides Churchville-Chili’s Dynamic Duo with their own personal Legion of Doom to battle against. Name an individual event or relay, and odds are a Panther tops the list.
Pittsford sits atop the latest Democrat and Chronicle’s large-schools swimming poll, whereas the Saints were left off, despite the efforts of Regelsberger and Crist. This isn’t the result the pair envisioned at the start of their final high school season, but are doing everything they can to unify their team and help it succeed.
As team leaders, much of the responsibility falls on the Saints’ standout seniors.
It will take a super-human effort to get Churchville-Chili back into the Class A team sectionals picture, but Regelsberger and Crist have the talent to pull it off.

2547,"A teenage health crisis led Surbhi Sarna to found a company aimed at detecting ovarian cancer early. Today Boston Scientific is purchasing the startup firm for up to $275 million.
A quest to detect ovarian cancer for other women led Sarna, 32, to found a company, nVision Medical of San Bruno, Calif., to raise $17 million in venture capital, and to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration to develop a specialized device for detecting ovarian cancer. (The device is not yet for sale.) Now Boston Scientific, the Marlborough, Mass.-based medical device giant, says it will buy nVision for $150 million upfront and another $125 million to be paid if certain clinical and commercial milestones are hit over the next four years. Sarna, who was on Forbes' 30 Under 30 In Healthcare list in 2014, plans to remain with the company.
""I did not start this company because I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I was looking for some concept,"" says Sarna. ""I did not start this company because I wanted to be a CEO or I wanted to be in charge. Those were all necessary things that I needed to do to get this product to where it needed to go. Now, this is the best place for me to be in order to keep seeing that happen.""
The market opportunity for the device could be from $500 million to $2 billion annually, says David Pierce, an executive vice president at Boston Scientific and president of the company's MedSurg division. Some 300,000 women have their ovaries removed each year, he says, mostly because they either have suspicious masses on them or because they carry a version of the BRCA gene that makes them very likely to develop cancer. The nVision device aims to give doctors a way to watch for cancer in these patients. ""We're really excited about this acquisition,"" Pierce says. ""The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is a massive unmet need in this space."" The deal could be accretive to Boston Scientific's earnings as soon as 2020.
Sarna is the daughter of Indian immigrants. Her mother, a Ph.D. in Hindi literature, stayed home to raise her children. Her father, an engineer, worked at a series of startups. She founded nVision straight out of college in 2009, continuing to work day jobs in the medical device industry. She had few connections, and often met with deaf ears. ""I've been in several boardrooms with all male VCs who are like, 'Oh. This is a women's issue,"" she says.
After a year and a half, she managed to raise $250,000. Her biggest backer was Darshana Zaveri, a woman who was a partner at Catalyst Health Ventures. Sarna hired an engineer named David Snow, who had been her boss at her last medical device job. Together they faced a huge engineering challenge. They needed to collect cells from the Fallopian tubes, which lead from the ovaries to the uterus. But these tubes, Sarna says, are a millimeter wide, between four and 12 centimeters long, and have, in he words, ""the consistency of wet paper towel."" Trying to push a catheter through them would risk damaging that delicate tissue.
Their solution? A balloon, which would follow the path up the Fallopian tube as it inflated, and would collect the cells on its surface. nVision conducted an initial 40-woman study to see if it could get the balloon into the Fallopian tube, and a second 40-woman study to prove that it could enter the full length of the tube and collect cells. A third study of woman who were having their ovaries removed compared the results of looking at the cells with the pathology reports on the ovaries to see if it could detect cancer. The results have not been published, but Sarna and Pierce both say that the test had high sensitivity and specificity. Contractually, the outside doctors who conducted the research have the right to be the first to release the results.
As nVision's product moved forward, investors became more interested. Astia Angels, an angel investing group, backed her, as did Michigan's Arboretum Ventures, which led a $12 million series B. She remembers first sitting down with a team from Boston Scientific at a medical meeting in Las Vegas several years ago. It was the end of the day, and they were all tired, but she remember the team's excitement. ""You know when someone just really gets something and understands it right away?"" she says. ""It was awesome.""
Last summer potential acquirers started expressing interest in the company. Sarna says she was in no hurry. Half her series B had not been spent, and Arboretum had set aside cash for another investment round. Boston Scientific was one potential buyer. But the meetings went so well that, at one point in negotiations, Sarna told a Boston Scientific executive: ""Hey. My team really likes your team."" She says she was thrilled that Boston is the company acquiring nVision. Thursday, two members of the Boston Scientific team flew across the country to take her to dinner at Octavia, an award-winning San Francisco Restaurant, where they ate steak and deviled eggs and talked for six hours. Her husband, an"," entrepreneur whose startup recently raised $60 million, was baffled that anyone could talk about work for so long.
The challenge will be convincing women and their doctors that it really is safe to watch for cancer using nVision's test. Boston Scientific plans a larger, 120-patient study. But Sarna says that women are already in a position of waiting and watching, and choosing to balance the health costs of removing their ovaries and going into early menopause and sacrificing some of their childbearing years with the risk of cancer. She says she wants to give them a better option than existing diagnostics, which she scoffs are no better than flipping a coin.

""This is a great fit,"" says Pierce, of the acquisition. ""Boston Scientific has a lot of resources; they have a lot of talented researchers and clinical people. As a company, we really believe in the mission.""
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of Lester's term, which is set to end in January 2019. Sarna will stay on as CEO and president of nVision. The company will be called Boston Scientific nVision Medical, and the company's shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""BMSN.""
Sarna says she is excited to see what Boston Scientific can do with nVision. ""I think this is going to be a very, very significant move in the space,"" she says. ""This is going to be a game changer.""

When the dinner was over, Sarna says, she hugged each of the team members and asked them how they were doing. ""We were so grateful to be working together,"" she says. ""We were just so excited. We were just so appreciative."" The dinner was a good sign, of course: The more interested a venture capitalist is in a company, the harder it is to move forward.
Sarna has met some of her first-round investors since the deal was announced. Sarna says that the venture capitalists who met her are now excited about the company.

8970,"Viacom Inc.'s chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, is expected to tell investors and analysts at an industry conference in California today that his company will put most of Simon & Schuster, its $2 billion publishing operation, up for sale, people involved in the sale said yesterday.
Simon & Schuster's educational publishing businesses will most likely be put on the block. But Viacom is expected to hold onto the Simon & Schuster trade imprint, which has published such recent best sellers as ''Diana: Her True Story -- In Her Own Words,'' by Andrew Morton; ''The Christmas Box,'' by Richard Paul Evans, and ''Wait Till Next Year,'' by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company is said to have been hired to handle the sale, which analysts say could fetch $4 billion to $4.5 billion.
A Viacom spokesman declined to comment.
A Simon & Schuster sale has long been expected. Ever since Viacom acquired Paramount Communications in 1994, Mr. Redstone has shown little interest in the publishing operations.
When Paramount was independent, the book business assured steady earnings to stabilize the more volatile movie and television operations. But after the merger, Viacom's cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, offered the same type of stability and more opportunities for entertainment programming and marketing. The profit margins for the cable network business are also far higher.
The educational publishing division does, however, own some fast-growing operations, including Computer Curriculum Publishing, which provides computer programs for schools, and the Educational Management Group, which delivers live interactive custom curriculums to two million students in 4,000 schools.
It is not clear yet whether the Simon & Schuster businesses would be sold in pieces or as a whole.
Educational publishers like McGraw-Hill and Harcourt Brace might be interested in acquiring the kindergarden-through-high school publishing business or the college textbook operation; other companies may want just Computer Curriculum.
Bantam Doubleday Dell, owned by Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant, has been widely speculated to be interested in buying into Simon & Schuster. Stuart Applebaum, a Bantam Doubleday spokesman, however, said yesterday that the company was not interested in the educational division but only in trade publishing, a unit not expected to be up for sale.
A top executive at Simon & Schuster said that all the decisions were being made out of Viacom and that they knew little about the parent company's plans. Meetings are scheduled today for the division's top executives with Simon & Schuster's chief executive, Jonathan Newcomb.
According to people involved with the sale, Viacom has not yet begun circulating the detailed financial data that buyers require to analyze a prospective acquisition. Still, Viacom is said to hope a deal will be completed by the second or third quarter of 1998.
In the 1996 fiscal year, Simon & Schuster accounted for $2.3 billion of the company's $12.1 billion in revenue and for $217 million of the $1.2 billion in operating income.
In contrast, the company's cable networks and broadcasting business generated roughly the same revenue, $2.4 billion, but $630 million in operating income -- or nearly three times that of the publishing business. Since 1994, the book business's profits have jumped only 12.7 percent, while the network and broadcasting business has seen a 95 percent surge in profits.
Viacom had considered spinning off some of its publishing assets, but in order to do a spinoff without generating large taxes, the company would have to to hold onto the assets for at least"," five years. That would have forced it to keep Simon & Schuster until 1999, clearly too long for Mr. Redstone.
''They're biting the bullet,'' said John Tinker an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ''But the real question now is how much they actually get and how fast they can actually pay off'' Viacom's $8 billion debt, he said.
The consumer book division, the Simon & Schuster operation that Viacom is said to be keeping, is a business that generally makes little money and operates at low margins. Still, the business offers Viacom the chance to cross-market books and films.
Not every media company, however, has been interested in such potential synergies. The Seagram Company, for example, which acquired both the publisher Putnam Berkley Group and Universal Studios when it acquired MCA, decided in 1996 to sell the publisher to Pearson P.L.C.'s Penguin Group for $336 million.",967,767,200,100.24250078201294,111.08856892585754,"[[0.8124759793281555, 0.5380213856697083, 0.6042882204055786, 0.906955361366272, 0.7361302375793457, 0.8163923025131226, 0.9421350955963135, 0.6073607802391052, 0.7105484008789062, 0.6196650266647339, 0.4734176695346832, 0.6665144562721252, 0.9397507905960083, 0.7878632545471191, 0.8447666168212891, 0.8843231797218323, 0.4478212594985962, 0.7182847857475281, 0.8416426181793213, 0.35940495133399963, 0.35188522934913635, 0.35216614603996277, 0.4298632740974426, 0.7242000102996826, 0.9492695331573486, 0.7331815958023071, 0.5625775456428528, 0.9737780690193176, 0.393646776676178, 0.821548581123352, 0.9686440229415894, 0.846861720085144, 0.6822891235351562, 0.9748740792274475, 0.6395673155784607, 0.690720796585083, 0.8076552152633667, 0.596072256565094, 0.4913351833820343, 0.6654250025749207, 0.8625291585922241, 0.9248268604278564, 0.839626669883728, 0.6606301665306091, 0.7847028374671936, 0.7885171175003052, 0.5843408703804016, 0.76779705286026, 0.7505542635917664, 0.7595598697662354, 0.9466549158096313, 0.9153580069541931, 0.834639310836792, 0.7209945917129517, 0.7499566078186035, 0.950408399105072, 0.6450279355049133, 0.8366732597351074, 0.9342015981674194, 0.7776731252670288, 0.9363623857498169, 0.4703065752983093, 0.6505562663078308, 0.8553903698921204, 0.711570680141449, 0.7727970480918884, 0.8945367336273193, 0.870629608631134, 0.8962292671203613, 0.3892369866371155, 0.8514904975891113, 0.9382662773132324, 0.9185891151428223, 0.7541734576225281, 0.8929699063301086, 0.3873229920864105, 0.6854592561721802, 0.3591558635234833, 0.7042093873023987, 0.35211119055747986, 0.6158250570297241, 0.8718308210372925, 0.8123175501823425, 0.7678758502006531, 0.8885766267776489, 0.8186549544334412, 0.6985673308372498, 0.3538225591182709, 0.49738410115242004, 0.8267919421195984, 0.45598480105400085, 0.7278298735618591, 0.3876520097255707, 0.45931562781333923, 0.5193565487861633, 0.9563590884208679, 0.9530574083328247, 0.5854032039642334, 0.8170085549354553, 0.877270519733429, 0.7774900794029236, 0.8729962706565857, 0.9279588460922241, 0.3647390902042389, 0.9418333768844604, 0.3572649359703064, 0.37305155396461487, 0.788336455821991, 0.7481381893157959, 0.6872521042823792, 0.9160630702972412, 0.8566423058509827, 0.7150768637657166, 0.8554647564888, 0.8951502442359924, 0.3629883825778961, 0.907500684261322, 0.9339042901992798, 0.7275941371917725, 0.8877391815185547, 0.6486268639564514, 0.43020275235176086, 0.4799761474132538, 0.4422895908355713, 0.3523344397544861, 0.7020360231399536, 0.515251874923706, 0.8342651724815369, 0.8614410161972046, 0.3517463505268097, 0.8705439567565918, 0.5840887427330017, 0.8688357472419739, 0.35225701332092285, 0.8937069773674011, 0.8414391279220581, 0.44136226177215576, 0.9414588212966919, 0.36521777510643005, 0.5248156785964966, 0.9004449844360352, 0.4661412537097931, 0.6120537519454956, 0.8647567629814148, 0.5225064158439636, 0.8451658487319946, 0.7819259166717529, 0.3591921627521515, 0.9053058624267578, 0.757881224155426, 0.6274521350860596, 0.8453060388565063, 0.5880334377288818, 0.9246404767036438, 0.5180766582489014, 0.6644181609153748, 0.7429265975952148, 0.8436049818992615, 0.6178104877471924, 0.4830058515071869, 0.7441704869270325, 0.680037260055542, 0.663008451461792, 0.6157010793685913, 0.6967030763626099, 0.593151330947876, 0.539191484451294, 0.3566863238811493, 0.5195301175117493, 0.5184249877929688, 0.7260278463363647, 0.6174232363700867, 0.9018523693084717, 0.5339668393135071, 0.5946595072746277, 0.5431535243988037, 0.7296628355979919, 0.49118539690971375, 0.40537866950035095, 0.3555988371372223, 0.6615569591522217, 0.6556523442268372, 0.4319547414779663, 0.9471117258071899, 0.9184765219688416, 0.7837563753128052, 0.9042063355445862, 0.9640048742294312, 0.720194399356842, 0.950573205947876, 0.5476347804069519, 0.9317382574081421, 0.8300746083259583, 0.8557855486869812, 0.8399137258529663, 0.7944396138191223, 0.6741271615028381, 0.950352132320404, 0.8626981973648071, 0.6340295076370239]]"," five years.
The publishing division has long been viewed as a potential part of a larger reorganization of Viacom. In June, the company announced a plan to separate its cable networks and broadcasting operations into two separate companies, a move that could put the publishing division on the block.
Viacom has also been looking at ways to sell part of its holdings in Paramount, the movie studio, to a group of private equity firms. Viacom has hired Morgan Stanley to find buyers for these assets.
Viacom's management has been under pressure from investors to sell some of its businesses. In April, the company said it would acquire a 50 percent stake in Viacom Communications, a unit that owns 24 radio stations. Viacom is also reportedly planning a stock buyback.
In recent months, the company has also been considering a sale of its 30 percent stake in MTV Networks, which controls MTV, VH-1, CMT, and the National Public Radio"," six years to offset the tax consequences of the split.
Some analysts are betting that a Simon & Schuster sale will help the company deal with its tax liabilities and position it for future growth.
But others believe a sale of the publishing arm will be too expensive. The book division is not a high-profit operation, and a small spinoff could generate only $500 million to $600 million in additional revenue, a source familiar with the company's thinking said.
The book division is not currently a source of long-term earnings growth. The publishing division is expected to grow at a low to mid-teens annual rate through at least 2001, according to the company's long-term projections. The publishing business is expected to grow at a rate of 10 percent annually through 2001. The cable network and broadcasting businesses are expected to grow at rates of 12.5 to 13.5 percent annually.
The publisher has been seeking to improve its finances by shifting its focus to video games and",200,200,0.5012125039100647,0.5554428446292877,"{'num_tokens_scored': 192, 'num_green_tokens': 111, 'green_fraction': 0.578125, 'z_score': 10.5, 'p_value': 4.319006317809202e-26, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  1.6667,  2.3094,  2.8402,  3.2998,  3.7097,  3.2660,

8636,"Zuke Chutoro, seared Bluefin tuna cured in Soy sauce at Kusakabe in San Francisco, Calif., is seen on Saturday, July 19th, 2014.
Sitting in Kusakabe at the light polished wood sushi counter, cut from a single tree, with a delicate glass pitcher of sake, a small hand towel in a black saucer and the fifth of 11 courses, the thought emerges: This style of refined dining could also be a boon for fixed-price Western restaurants.
The people who say they wouldn't go to the French Laundry, Benu or Saison because of the precious parade of courses, the formal atmosphere and the extended length of time at the table are some of the same people sitting at the sushi counter eating one bite of delicate sushi after another, as one hour slips into the next.
It's hard not to be captivated by the skill of chef-owner Mitsunori Kusakabe. There are no decisions to be made as diners sit back, relax and are taken on a culinary journey that costs $95 for 11 dishes, mostly sushi but with a soup course and another hot dish.
Dinner begins with a briny broth of kelp tea designed to decompress the 17 patrons at the sushi bar and the 12 who are seated at tables. The waiter also brings a damp black finger towel so diners can wipe their fingers after picking up the sushi with their hands - the way suggested by the waiter, who is as calming as the tea.
Kusakabe defines his menu as omakase sushi, kaiseki style, referring to two distinct types of dining. Kaiseki is a set menu, precisely designed and served. A true omakase menu is based on individual diners' preferences gleaned from their ongoing relationship with the chef. It's a menu built on trust.
Yet in a broader sense the term is accurate here because the chef creates the menu; it's somewhat standardized, but on each of my three visits he made adjustments. Every ingredient is sliced, chopped, drizzled and squeezed to order.
For the first course, the chef places a piece of bluefin tuna, dark from its soy sauce cure, on a small pad of rice. He briefly torches half the flesh to caramelize it, intensify the flavor and firm up the texture - an artful contrast in a single bite.
Next comes a piece of halibut sliced to order, with shallow slits in the flesh to help diffuse the flavorings. The chef adds a dab of its liver gently scooped from a tiny tin, places it on the center of the white flesh, dribbles on a soy-like sauce and tops it with delicate ribbons of shiso. Next up is bonito with a small mound of pickled daikon and rings of scallions.
The sashimi - slices of amber jack and halibut because I am allergic to the scallops that would normally be part of the mix - is arranged on a mound of what looks like snow cone ice accompanied by a soy dipping sauce and a chunky blend of yuzu and onions.
Miso soup offered a warm change of pace, an intense broth with two tender duck meatballs, mitsuba (Japanese parsley) and a hint of sansho peppers. On other visits the soup featured summer truffles floating among the ribbons of herbs, with eringi and shimeji mushrooms visible just below the surface. The flavors are at once strong and subtle.
Next comes what's labeled unique sushi, although everything that came before could be described the same way. In this case, ""unique"" meant Tasmanian trout cured in kombu on two squares of rice flavored with cilantro and sesame seed. It was finished with sesame miso to bring all the flavors together.
On subsequent visits, the chef served a rice flour cracker that resembled a small pottery bowl shaped like a flower. It's so shiny and well formed that the chef had to tell me to pick it up and eat the entire thing, because I had started to use chopsticks to pick up the rice and barbecued eel on top.
Next is the second warm dish, which was the same on all three visits - two finger-size pieces of crab on tofu, caked in crispy rice and garnished with a slice of key lime so thin it looked like parchment. The waiter then pours on Hokkaido kombu dashi broth. It's yet another example of the tension between bold, subtle, crisp, creamy, warm and cool - the dish touches all those notes. This type of juxtaposition describes many of Kusakabe's dishes.
The next two bites, labeled ""sushi chic,"" included striped bass with a sprinkling of sea salt, gratings of Meyer lemon peel and a few drops of juice. In between each course the chef wipes off the black lacquer rectangles on the shelf above the counter in front of each diner, and replenishes the small bowls of pickled ginger.
For her part, the server is always subtly looking over diners' shoulders, answering questions and helping them to decide what to order from 16 sakes, 16 wines or five beers.
The sake is available in a 3-ounce glass, 6-ounce carafe or by the bottle. Each round is served in different containers - crystal cubes, thick earthen pottery, translucent green cups and long-stemmed wineglasses for the more expensive Daiginjo ($15-$30 for a 3-ounce pour).
The meal continues to progress from lighter to heavier preparations. Next is what turns out to be the most intriguing dish of all - Copper River salmon with just a sprig of microgreens on top. I could have sworn there was a brush of maple syrup because it was so sweet, but we were simply tasting the natural essence of the fish. In just about every case, the fish is served at the perfect stage for sushi.
To finish, there's a choice: a slice of A5 Wagyu or toro - a lush, fatty piece of fish - on a pad of rice and topped with a small knob of wasabi.
That's the end of the tasting menu. From there, diners can order from 20 a la carte sushi or sashimi items or, if you have an appetite like mine, you might want to try the expertly prepared Santa Barbara sea urchin ($8.50 per piece), Hokkaido uni ($14) or barbecued white eel ($14). Then there's whiting cured with kombu and bonito"," flakes ($8.50), cherrywood-smoked bonito ($8.50) and five maki rolls, including one with braised Japanese squash ($7.50).
Desserts are also extra: mild green tea creme brulee ($6) and a refreshing yuzu and shiso ice ($4.50) topped with a green tea cookie in the shape of a K.
By the time you get to that point you feel as satisfied and refreshed as if you've had a relaxing massage and rest.
On my last visit, as I was paying the bill, the gracious waiter leaned over and whispered that if I let them know next time, they would do preparations differently from the printed menu. Finally I discovered what a true omakase menu might mean.

The dining room where Kusakabe and his staff serve the food is reminiscent of a French Bistro. There's a long dining room with matching tables, a kitchen, a bar and a waiting area.
The chef also has two restaurants that serve more casual sushi and sashimi dishes. If you're looking for a place to have drinks at the sushi bar, Kusakabe's is the place. You can also order the sake by the glass or by the bottle from the bar.
Like everything else Kusakabe does, it's carefully thought through, executed to perfection and perfectly priced.

The sushi is delicious, the presentation is inventive and the service is attentive.
But the food doesn't go to waste in this dining setting. The fish is kept in a refrigerator on a shelf just a few steps away from the table, and the chef-owner takes time to set it out for the next diner to enjoy. It's a rare sight to see this level of attention to detail. Anti-sushi folks might not be impressed by the attention to detail, but the experience is nonetheless unique and enjoyable.

The chef said ""Omakase is not my specialty, I do a lot of sushi and other fish I do a lot of, and I don't really know how to describe it. It is not meant to be a formal dining.""

8637,"BULLISH Alex McLeish is not expecting the chop when he meets Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner next week.
McLeish’s first season in charge has seen him narrowly avoid ­relegation and furious fans have called for his head.
With a record low four wins at home this season, McLeish has had to endure torrents of abuse from disgruntled supporters.
But he revealed that he will go into talks with"," the board outlining the kind of budget he thinks he needs to start turning the club around.
Big Eck said he hadn’t given any consideration to question marks over his future.
He said: “I haven’t ­given that any thought at all. Hopefully now we can move forward.
“I’ve been in charge one season. Did anyone expect me to win the league? Come on – I think people have to be more understanding.
“I anticipate being here next season. Yes, we have underachieved for a football club like Aston Villa.

Asked if he would welcome a takeover, McLeish said: “Yes, certainly. I think the way we’ve gone about this season, where we’ve got relegated, and the expectation was that we would be relegated, I think it’s a shame that people are going out of their way to criticise my performance.
“It’s a shame that people have got so carried away in their criticism. I think we’ve got a good squad, a good group of players and we’ve got a good relationship with the fans. I think we’ve got a good relationship with everyone in the club.
“I believe in the squad we have, I believe in the club and I think we’ve got a good pathway for us to have a good season next season.
“I’ve spoken to the owner"," Lerner, who is known for frugal spenders, before the clash on January 31.
The Scot said: “We had some tough games and a great game against Leeds, who are similar Connection to Aston Villa.
“After that game, a lot of people said we were relegation candidates, but the players were fantastic against Leeds.
“The first game we lost to Reading, it could have been worse, in their half, to be honest, but then we beat Sheffield Wednesday and got out of that one.
“We had a really good game against Watford, a great game against Leeds, who are similar to Aston Villa.
“After that game, a lot of people said we were relegation candidates, but the players were fantastic against Leeds, who are similar to Aston Villa.
“After the Watford game, a lot of people said we would go down, but the players performed to the level we required to get three points against",200,200,0.3621670269966126,0.41629652500152586,"{'num_tokens_scored': 147, 'num_green_tokens': 84, 'green_fraction': 0.5714285714285714, 'z_score': 9.0, 'p_value': 1.1285884059538324e-19, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([1.7321, 2.4495, 1.6667, 2.3094, 2.8402, 3.2998, 3.7097, 3.2660, 2.8868,

5184,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - U.S. and Russian flight controllers worked to fully restore computers aboard the International Space Station on Thursday after a system crash that could force the $100 billion outpost’s crew back to Earth.
NASA said it did not regard the problem as critical and believed it was a long way from having to contemplate abandoning the space station, a 16-nation project.
But the U.S. space agency made plans to keep the visiting space shuttle Atlantis attached to the station for an extra day to help steer the massive complex if the Russian computers, which control navigation, continue to malfunction.
“We’re still struggling to understand what the real problem is here,” said NASA’s associate administrator for spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier.
Flight directors told the crew to cut power to noncritical equipment, like lighting, to conserve electricity and fuel in case the shuttle’s mission to the space station is extended.
In the worst-case scenario, the three astronauts aboard the station, including NASA’s newly arrived Clayton Anderson, could leave in the escape ship, a Russian Soyuz capsule.
As a precaution, the Soyuz was put on battery power on Wednesday for seven hours before one primary and one auxiliary computer system in the Russian modules were rebooted on Thursday, allowing the capsule to be returned to station power.
Two other primary systems, which control navigation and operate life support systems like an oxygen generator and air purifiers, remained shut down.
The station has backup systems for life support and the shuttle has been firing its control jets to help it maintain proper orbit.
“We won’t ask you how you’re doing because we can imagine,” a Russian flight director, speaking through a translator, said to station commander Fyodor Yurckikhin, who skipped a night’s sleep to work on the computer problems.
The computer glitches began shortly after a newly installed solar wing panel began producing power. Gerstenmaier said it would likely take days to find out why the computers were misbehaving.
Work continued on Thursday on the retraction of the second half of an older solar wing panel that must be moved before the new array can rotate and track the sun for full power.
Spacewalking astronauts Patrick Forrester and Steven Swanson helped guide the old wing into its storage"," box on Wednesday. Their crewmates James Reilly and John “Danny” Olivas are due to finish the job during a spacewalk on Friday.
Reilly and Olivas also are scheduled to repair a bit of protruding insulation near the rear of the shuttle. A corner of the blanket tore loose during Atlantis’ launch six days ago, potentially exposing inner layers of the shuttle’s surface to superheated gases on re-entry.
NASA had already extended Atlantis’ mission from 11 to 13 days and added a fourth spacewalk to make sure there was enough time to fix the blanket and retract the old solar wing.
The astronauts must also prepare other station systems for the arrival of new laboratory units and life support equipment for an expanded, six-person resident crew.

Forrester said it would take a few more days to get the second half of the new solar panel attached to the old panel.
The computer glitches were the most serious problem to hit the station since Russian cosmonauts launched the station in 1998.
Gerstenmaier said NASA was working to identify the root cause of the malfunction and get the computers back to working properly.
The computer malfunction came just days before the launch of a Russian-built spacecraft that will deliver four new astronauts to the orbiting outpost.
The Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft is scheduled to launch from Kazakhstan on Friday and reach the station in October for a six-month stay.
The mission is set to be the first of two more trips to the station this year by the Soyuz capsule, which will continue to be used to take astronauts into orbit.

6748,"Napier shearer Ricci Stevens on Saturday night in Te Kuiti adding the New Zealand Senior shearing title to the woolhandling title he won two days earlier.
Napier shearer Ricci Stevens completed a unique double of doubles on Saturday night when he won a New Zealand Senior shearing title final, which would almost inevitably have its own special place in shearing sports history whomever won.
The 26-year-old had also on Thursday won the senior woolhandling title, having also previously won the junior titles in both aspects of the shearing sports – shearing in 2015 and woolhandling last year.
No other competitor has won New Zealand championships titles in both shearing and woolhandling.
The runner-up was King Country-based Catherine Mullooly, who as a junior on the same stage in 2014 became the first woman to be named top-ranked competitor in any grade of shearing and who last night was just 1.145pts from becoming the first female senior winner since the championships were first held as the King Country Shears in 1985.
Third place went to South Island-based Luis Pincol, from Chile, just 2.211pts from scoring the biggest-ever win by a shearer from South America.
The shape of the senior final changed dramatically when top-ranked Tegwyn Bradley, of Woodville, winner of 14 other finals during the season including the Golden Shears, was eliminated in the semifinals on Saturday afternoon.
Son-in-law of 2017 world champion and employer John Kirkpatrick, Stevens made his intentions clear",", more than 20 seconds clear of nearest challengers Mullooly and Pincol through the halfway stage and ultimately shearing the 12 sheep in 13min 58.38sec, half a minute clear of eventual second-man-off and Gore-based fourth placegetter Lionel Taumata, from Taumarunui.
Mullooly was third to finish, in 13min 31.28sec, and was by more than a point the best shearer in the board judging, but suffered in the judging in the pens afterwards.
The 2017 Intermediate champion, Masterton-based Sean Gouk, was fifth and sixth was Whakapunaki (Naki) Maraki, of Flaxmere, who on Thursday was fourth in the Junior woolhandling final won by partner Ngaira Puha.
Stevens has the choice of going up to open grade in both shearing and woolhandling next season, but is still just short of the threshold for upgrading.",526,326,200,81.72895669937134,92.5374870300293,"[[0.8183194994926453, 0.409656822681427, 0.6774563193321228, 0.8278036117553711, 0.4755890965461731, 0.7380446195602417, 0.38258910179138184, 0.8460225462913513, 0.9620653986930847, 0.3773009479045868, 0.925475001335144, 0.4544605314731598, 0.4652295410633087, 0.8653693199157715, 0.6947678923606873, 0.4620148539543152, 0.8630615472793579, 0.8727478981018066, 0.9471698999404907, 0.9569124579429626, 0.853762686252594, 0.8185129761695862, 0.6946387887001038, 0.9563338756561279, 0.8177503347396851, 0.7687438130378723, 0.8006466627120972, 0.8930745124816895, 0.841407060623169, 0.8179389238357544, 0.7459713220596313, 0.6828569173812866, 0.6421400308609009, 0.5745821595191956, 0.7932738065719604, 0.8597763776779175, 0.8773974180221558, 0.9517722725868225, 0.8307795524597168, 0.8005706071853638, 0.948136568069458, 0.6148641109466553, 0.7248624563217163, 0.7303420305252075, 0.768836498260498, 0.9275823831558228, 0.8250777125358582, 0.9729559421539307, 0.8258252739906311, 0.5021283626556396, 0.799899697303772, 0.6521930694580078, 0.9949849843978882, 0.6383578181266785, 0.6997594833374023, 0.9738374352455139, 0.6950854659080505, 0.7643392086029053, 0.9607260227203369, 0.6745074391365051, 0.7547777891159058, 0.7987592816352844, 0.4811707139015198, 0.7840954661369324, 0.5434929132461548, 0.3976629078388214, 0.8704255819320679, 0.8667848110198975, 0.9795076847076416, 0.8212633728981018, 0.6310285925865173, 0.549116849899292, 0.8602280020713806, 0.5293858051300049, 0.3516775965690613, 0.791698694229126, 0.9516785144805908, 0.6093277931213379, 0.8114434480667114, 0.7526390552520752, 0.7910933494567871, 0.8574827909469604, 0.8352141380310059, 0.4745978116989136, 0.8790017366409302, 0.7477744817733765, 0.9446250796318054, 0.736183226108551, 0.8808049559593201, 0.4636770486831665, 0.7509415149688721, 0.8250223994255066, 0.7624659538269043, 0.5887154340744019, 0.93426114320755, 0.9069344997406006, 0.8036673069000244, 0.7942255139350891, 0.6022053360939026, 0.5370252728462219, 0.7166599631309509, 0.907542884349823, 0.3592488169670105, 0.3763294219970703, 0.8449554443359375, 0.5895508527755737, 0.6858003735542297, 0.501442551612854, 0.7552078366279602, 0.8972247242927551, 0.82666015625, 0.5612813830375671, 0.7791339755058289, 0.35939162969589233, 0.416061133146286, 0.7266826629638672, 0.8077106475830078, 0.8937276005744934, 0.833967387676239, 0.7521792054176331, 0.39227157831192017, 0.8006129264831543, 0.6977404952049255, 0.8597079515457153, 0.8554073572158813, 0.8917599320411682, 0.8415172100067139, 0.649538516998291, 0.6233189105987549, 0.570724368095398, 0.9147986769676208, 0.7760434746742249, 0.7479726672172546, 0.7081592082977295, 0.878913164138794, 0.9183686375617981, 0.6724518537521362, 0.6073799133300781, 0.5133172273635864, 0.7249913811683655, 0.77625972032547, 0.5187162160873413, 0.5513635277748108, 0.7762020826339722, 0.6666560769081116, 0.8642187118530273, 0.7907472848892212, 0.47517651319503784, 0.3713650107383728, 0.7192401885986328, 0.7031256556510925, 0.6892378926277161, 0.8757818341255188, 0.9244884252548218, 0.6601276397705078, 0.8486042618751526, 0.7786098122596741, 0.3576566278934479, 0.9330460429191589, 0.351688414812088, 0.8640246391296387, 0.9470800161361694, 0.9385655522346497, 0.9603947401046753, 0.7349882125854492, 0.8023632764816284, 0.8798972964286804, 0.6103122234344482, 0.7232283353805542, 0.7147905230522156, 0.879770040512085, 0.5317906737327576, 0.8694754242897034, 0.8874398469924927, 0.6490123867988586, 0.7628724575042725, 0.6892792582511902, 0.7551990151405334, 0.7288356423377991, 0.9656476378440857, 0.5268456935882568, 0.5599218606948853, 0.5172880291938782, 0.6584645509719849, 0.7958811521530151, 0.7734256982803345, 0.901911735534668, 0.6695384979248047, 0.9005134105682373, 0.8851407766342163, 0.9227909445762634, 0.7201659679412842, 0.6074970364570618, 0.43733444809913635, 0.8270214796066284, 0.7191733717918396, 0.6901893615722656, 0.4167928397655487, 0.9140634536743164, 0.351776123046875]]"," from the start and led from start to finish, going into the final run with a 4pt lead over second-placed Pincol.
Pincol made a good start on the second throw and Stevens got a good lifter on the third but Pincol got the next one to go and just missed a great cut, leaving Stevens in a comfortable lead.
The final run was much closer than the first and Pincol gave a good run but just missed a cut and Stevens even managed to get a lifter on the second throw, leaving him in a comfortable lead.
There was very little chance of a good run in the final run and Pincol got a cut but Stevens even managed to get a lifter on the second throw.
That put Stevens into the lead and he went on to win by 1.6pts from Pincol with Mullooly third.
Stevens said he was pleased, but not surprised, that he had won the title"," from the outset when it came to the shearing part of the contest.
As the pair headed off to the second round of the main championship series earlier that afternoon, he told the media he was well aware he would be facing the reigning world champion in Tim Annett of Wellington, the third seed, in the final.
But his main aim was to beat Annett and win the title he was chasing.
""The title is on now, and it is on my shoulder,"" Stevens told The New Zealand Herald on Thursday. ""I knew it was going to be a long night.
""This is my first title of any of my competitions. It is a lot to take in and a little bit of a shock to the system. It is a lot to process.""
Annett had been the world champion from 2012 to 2015, warmed by the fact he led Stevens to a third-place title in 2017 in Wellington and is now on top of the world again.
