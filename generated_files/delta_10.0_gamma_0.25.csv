9793,"""As it becomes more difficult to defend Obama, the probability of a charge of racism approaches.""
""It is becoming well nigh impossible to deny the racist overtones of these protests.""
What, may you ask, is the strongest argument for this astounding claim?
""Many of the virtually all-white crowd on Saturday yearned for an earlier time with less government involvement in society.""
You read that correctly: the fact that this crowd was predominantly caucasian (by Winters&apos; account), proves that it must be racist. By Winters&apos; logic, the United States Senate must be ""racist"" - it is ""virtually all-white"", after all.
""But, that earlier time [of less government involvement in society] recalls, for many of us, the memory of states’ rights being enforced through dogs and water cannons.""
3)... the anti-tax marchers want a return to racial segregation.
That is Winters&apos; argument, in three easy steps.
Liberal Catholics will go ballistic when a conservative Catholic writer makes an absurd argument, and demand that fellow conservatives disown the maverick&apos;s argument. Because, on the whole, we strive to be reasonable and agreeable people, we typically do so. We can call one of our own out of bounds without feeling we&apos;ve eroded our common arguments. We can call crazy ""crazy"" because we try to avoid it. Winters seems to be reduced to just writing crazy.
Well, in similar fashion",", I&apos;d like to see some ""liberal"" Catholic writers take Winters to the woodshed for this one. People who don&apos;t like Obama don&apos;t like him because they are racist - really?! Is anyone typically sympathetic to Winters prepared to defend this claim of his? There are many more people in America who did not attend this march who are sympathetic to the concerns of those who did attend. Are all of them equally guilty of the racism Winters ascribes?
I&apos;ll be waiting for such logical reflection on these claims Winters has injected into the debate.
But frankly, until Winters himself retracts this stupidity, I&apos;ll feel free to disregard him completely.
After all, I shouldn&apos;t give my time to someone who writes for a racist magazine like America.
I mean, just look at the complexion of that magazine&apos;s editors.",522,322,200,24.388687133789062,60.29965329170227,"[[0.41949042677879333, 0.9130411744117737, 0.8364925384521484, 0.9398612976074219, 0.9421389102935791, 0.3594646453857422, 0.9265429973602295, 0.2502751052379608, 0.8523861169815063, 0.6123235821723938, 0.8358047604560852, 0.9405350685119629, 0.8708429932594299, 0.5179698467254639, 0.6405856609344482, 0.660033643245697, 0.5555171966552734, 0.9534215331077576, 0.7513195872306824, 0.9839065670967102, 0.8204222917556763, 0.6266684532165527, 0.9678823947906494, 0.5624501705169678, 0.5801709294319153, 0.2515007257461548, 0.2611709237098694, 0.9583137631416321, 0.617243766784668, 0.6180050373077393, 0.5171908140182495, 0.3338565528392792, 0.2615833878517151, 0.3155401051044464, 0.7582136988639832, 0.2855415642261505, 0.25033965706825256, 0.3552554249763489, 0.6221179962158203, 0.5059165954589844, 0.4763578176498413, 0.7121968269348145, 0.850869357585907, 0.8017722964286804, 0.25139325857162476, 0.2502187490463257, 0.39534783363342285, 0.7398339509963989, 0.7884804606437683, 0.5784247517585754, 0.8174631595611572, 0.6376601457595825, 0.8168119192123413, 0.2504786550998688, 0.25019291043281555, 0.40020662546157837, 0.4898892343044281, 0.2606923282146454, 0.3121941089630127, 0.2727459967136383, 0.45688194036483765, 0.7385066151618958, 0.25036439299583435, 0.2502395808696747, 0.40096163749694824, 0.43379729986190796, 0.2580389380455017, 0.2815932035446167, 0.2630667984485626, 0.3616120219230652, 0.6060460209846497, 0.2503517270088196, 0.2501696050167084, 0.3986814618110657, 0.3665439486503601, 0.25585857033729553, 0.26594826579093933, 0.257881760597229, 0.30564412474632263, 0.49175524711608887, 0.250408411026001, 0.250174880027771, 0.3882908821105957, 0.3296704590320587, 0.25545406341552734, 0.25953200459480286, 0.25537756085395813, 0.2865520417690277, 0.41947293281555176, 0.2504340708255768, 0.25020885467529297, 0.3776325583457947, 0.3043138384819031, 0.2540086507797241, 0.25658783316612244, 0.25430935621261597, 0.2776801586151123, 0.3838557004928589, 0.25046342611312866, 0.25018173456192017, 0.36612844467163086, 0.29772669076919556, 0.25299763679504395, 0.2554450035095215, 0.25352752208709717, 0.2731039822101593, 0.36298832297325134, 0.25042808055877686, 0.2501832842826843, 0.3478459119796753, 0.2921895682811737, 0.25232574343681335, 0.2547888159751892, 0.2530782222747803, 0.2724883258342743, 0.3542936146259308, 0.25044089555740356, 0.2501673698425293, 0.32791954278945923, 0.2905728220939636, 0.2520116865634918, 0.2544037103652954, 0.25289425253868103, 0.2729160785675049, 0.345979779958725, 0.2504318952560425, 0.2501523494720459, 0.31269994378089905, 0.2861020863056183, 0.25168371200561523, 0.25442472100257874, 0.25286269187927246, 0.2749011218547821, 0.3426118791103363, 0.2504623234272003, 0.2501281499862671, 0.3130914270877838, 0.28322985768318176, 0.25151553750038147, 0.2545934021472931, 0.25302064418792725, 0.27632230520248413, 0.3375697731971741, 0.2504889667034149, 0.2501390874385834, 0.3145878314971924, 0.2753240168094635, 0.25132042169570923, 0.2537025809288025, 0.2528713345527649, 0.2756759822368622, 0.3294898271560669, 0.25051218271255493, 0.25010308623313904, 0.31722843647003174, 0.2712189555168152, 0.2512437701225281, 0.2529778480529785, 0.25287285447120667, 0.27603664994239807, 0.31952306628227234, 0.2505027651786804, 0.25012117624282837, 0.3173239231109619, 0.2666032910346985, 0.2512078881263733, 0.25256532430648804, 0.2528499662876129, 0.2751316428184509, 0.32011374831199646, 0.25051963329315186, 0.250104695558548, 0.3170776069164276, 0.2648753821849823, 0.25116339325904846, 0.2521808445453644, 0.25284573435783386, 0.2738053500652313, 0.3245643079280853, 0.2505544126033783, 0.2501086890697479, 0.3209761381149292, 0.2620201110839844, 0.2511056661605835, 0.2516739070415497, 0.2527877390384674, 0.27295005321502686, 0.330497682094574, 0.250577837228775, 0.25010764598846436, 0.3188816010951996, 0.25975877046585083, 0.251049667596817, 0.2512712776660919, 0.2527365982532501, 0.2711896300315857, 0.3316357433795929, 0.2506755590438843, 0.2501072883605957, 0.3320602476596832]]",", liberals will go ballistic with Winters&apos; claim that the anti-tax movement (which, let us not forget, is a movement to lower taxes), is a movement to return to racial segregation.
And, that racial segregation is a result of the old Jim Crow system, and that is why the present day anti-tax movement is a restoration of that system.
Here is what Winters&apos; argument really says:
""It is becoming well nigh impossible to deny the racist overtones of these protests.""
If liberals are appalled by anti-tax protesters and their demands for racial segregation, then why have liberals been so silent when the Tea Party has been marching back and forth through the streets with identical demands for racial segregation?

If you have been working in an office environment for years, how do you know the difference between a cubicle and an actual office? These days, almost all of us are working from home, and this means that we all have a desk in front of our computer. Perhaps you’re one of the lucky ones that’s able to sit in your living room or kitchen. Whatever your workspace, you’re probably thankful to be in an environment that feels more like an actual office.

3801,"With so many hoops to jump through to close transactions, falling home prices, and unrealistic sellers and buyers, today’s agents have to hustle harder than ever before. This doesn’t have to be the case. With the right systems and the right processes in place, you can work smarter rather than hustling harder.
Everyone has systems. The question is: Which systems support your business to thrive vs. which systems create a drag on your production? A system can be as simple as taking a different route to work each day to search for for-sale-by-owner homes, or as complex as doing all your business online.
The hallmarks of a strong system are that it is repeatable, it reduces time and effort, and it yields consistent results. If you’re interested in working smarter rather than hustling harder, here are five areas where you can begin to systematize your business.
If you’re like most agents, you have multiple phone numbers on your business card. It’s much easier for clients to contact you on a single phone number. One of the simplest solutions is to use Google Voice. Google Voice provides you with a single phone number that goes to every one of your phones in the order you specify.
Your clients can find you easily, no matter where you are. Google Voice also allows you to keep your cell phone and your home phone private. When you are in a situation where you cannot take a voice call, Google Voice can transcribe your message into an email or text message. Surprisingly, there is no charge for this service, and it works both in the U.S. and Canada.
An increasing number of companies and agents are electing to go paperless. Many associations already publish their various contracts in a digital format. You can download these forms to any type of computer. They may also be available in the ""cloud,"" using systems such as DocuSign. Digital signatures can be obtained either through the equivalent of a lock-and-key approach (think of your credit card number tied to a password) or with an actual digital signature. On the tablet PCs, your clients sign their documents with a light pen. On the iPad, they can sign using their finger with apps such as Zosh.
Another way to go paperless is to create a digital pre-list package. In addition to the various forms and documents required to close a transaction, you can include a sample 90-day marketing plan, a digital brochure of the seller’s property, plus a link to the single-property website that you create for your sellers. Going paperless is one of the most effective ways to save both time and gasoline costs.
Many agents struggle with the idea of starting and maintaining a blog. There’s a simple solution, and it’s right in the outbox of your email. If you’re like most agents, you haven’t cleaned your outbox recently. If this is the case, look back through your past emails. Every email where you answered a client question is a potential blog post.
A simple way to create great content for your blog is to answer client questions using your blog rather than your email. Post both the question and the answer in your blog. You can also post market updates plus upcoming neighborhood events.
If you enjoy taking photos or videos, post them on your blog or your Facebook business page. Since most blogging platforms allow you to schedule your posts at a later date, increase the effectiveness of your system by doing all of your posts at the same time each week. Plug in the time and date you want the post published and the blogging platform handles it automatically.
Your interactions on social media are another great area to systematize. For example, if you have 150 Facebook friends, take 10 minutes each day to either ""like"" or comment on something that five of your friends post. At the end of the month, you will have contacted all 150 of your friends at least once.
Another approach is to use a system such as HootSuite. When you come across an article, picture, blog post, or some other online material that you believe your friends or followers may like, you can click the ""Tweet this"" button and HootSuite automatically creates a Tweet and posts to Facebook as well.
You can send the Tweet as is or modify it. The process takes just a few seconds and allows you to provide your followers with great information with a minimal amount of effort.","
How much time do you spend entering notes you have taken at listing appointments, inspections or walkthroughs on your computer? The paid version of Evernote allows you to take notes on your smartphone, iPad or personal computer. Evernote then makes those notes available on all of your Evernote-enabled devices simultaneously.
Instead of wasting time transferring this information from a handwritten form into a digital format, Evernote eliminates having to enter data twice saving you tremendous amounts of time and effort.
Which systems are best for you? The real test is in finding a system and then developing the habit of working with it regularly. The more you work with a system, the more efficient your use of the system becomes.
If the increasingly fast pace of the real estate business is draining your energy, a systems approach may be exactly what you need to put you back in control.

1713,"The value of Saudi industrial exports reached SR162 billion by the end of 2012 compared to SR110 million in 1974, Director General of Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) Ali Al-Ayed said.
Addressing a GCC industrial event in Oman, Al-Ayed said Saudi industrial exports have achieved high growth rates averaging 20 percent per year in the period 1974-2012.
It was organized by the Omani Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) in coordination with the Riyadh-based GCC general secretariat.
The SIDF chief attributed the robust growth of the industrial exports to the availability of hydrocarbons at preferential prices in addition to the conclusion of international and regional trade agreements to this end.
Plastic and chemical products accounted for 77"," percent of the total industrial exports in that year, followed by food products at 8 percent, base metals (6 percent), and electric devices and equipment (2 percent), he told the conference.
He said the SIDF used to adopt a series of measures to boost industrial exports, including attraction of foreign investments which had an effective role in transferring experience and technical know-how.
SIDF has approved SR42.2 billion, or 38 percent of total loans, for the industrial projects, he said.
He also enumerated a series of challenges facing local industries, notably how to diversify production and export base for local industries, upgrade technical knowledge, minimize global competition on local products, and how to boost efficiency of export logistics services.
The SIDF chief explored a number of recommendations for the development of national exports, including creation of a national strategy to develop industrial exports, expansion of regional and international trade cooperation and spread of awareness among investors and officials on the importance of exports.",362,162,200,19.388503074645996,57.97807288169861,"[[0.36457034945487976, 0.2878226041793823, 0.5036117434501648, 0.3960522711277008, 0.8454077839851379, 0.6549680233001709, 0.6245301365852356, 0.34968236088752747, 0.7125893831253052, 0.5629138946533203, 0.9241573810577393, 0.7636925578117371, 0.7529004812240601, 0.2529830038547516, 0.29007115960121155, 0.612263560295105, 0.5935545563697815, 0.5562090873718262, 0.6555941104888916, 0.7567789554595947, 0.3693707585334778, 0.35731661319732666, 0.43115726113319397, 0.8383076786994934, 0.37849822640419006, 0.5132083296775818, 0.9378071427345276, 0.7543129920959473, 0.26696768403053284, 0.9322486519813538, 0.8093116283416748, 0.3107345998287201, 0.2775678336620331, 0.8093979954719543, 0.9695979952812195, 0.2679983377456665, 0.7860504984855652, 0.7164815664291382, 0.37779417634010315, 0.4544263184070587, 0.6047011017799377, 0.540296196937561, 0.2862515151500702, 0.7365232110023499, 0.8616586327552795, 0.9011214375495911, 0.7669323086738586, 0.7871878743171692, 0.8584651947021484, 0.259125679731369, 0.8444929122924805, 0.8038756251335144, 0.9196279644966125, 0.522162675857544, 0.36457201838493347, 0.8902564644813538, 0.8716326355934143, 0.7890172600746155, 0.3740815222263336, 0.8475492000579834, 0.6381326913833618, 0.3870241343975067, 0.8354403376579285, 0.7618256211280823, 0.5870940685272217, 0.3515470027923584, 0.7242131233215332, 0.7548781037330627, 0.80143141746521, 0.5446882843971252, 0.7052867412567139, 0.9552277326583862, 0.45746690034866333, 0.8522628545761108, 0.7706102132797241, 0.7341000437736511, 0.3389866054058075, 0.7624609470367432, 0.6016805171966553, 0.7066656947135925, 0.6586205959320068, 0.32264167070388794, 0.7699401378631592, 0.2703787684440613, 0.26997923851013184, 0.25113874673843384, 0.7242981791496277, 0.3219761550426483, 0.33775594830513, 0.7470216751098633, 0.9543309211730957, 0.2592718005180359, 0.42686161398887634, 0.8264492750167847, 0.9229682087898254, 0.6387618184089661, 0.9280943274497986, 0.6447581052780151, 0.7973716259002686, 0.30273932218551636, 0.8555637001991272, 0.6315497159957886, 0.7571861147880554, 0.9380382299423218, 0.9303296804428101, 0.30809932947158813, 0.9358077645301819, 0.700283408164978, 0.8004119396209717, 0.42029568552970886, 0.7403814196586609, 0.9630712270736694, 0.7898175120353699, 0.8266900181770325, 0.908186674118042, 0.26322874426841736, 0.31250128149986267, 0.6671390533447266, 0.6284874081611633, 0.27859997749328613, 0.6878052949905396, 0.5975070595741272, 0.9031395316123962, 0.921531081199646, 0.8540893197059631, 0.9145166277885437, 0.25336575508117676, 0.58465975522995, 0.6491076946258545, 0.6706233620643616, 0.2523880898952484, 0.7806058526039124, 0.3819791376590729, 0.5990999937057495, 0.9283520579338074, 0.9503654837608337, 0.6750956177711487, 0.6233146786689758, 0.5192160606384277, 0.8890770077705383, 0.2928144335746765, 0.28691041469573975, 0.26740142703056335, 0.331628680229187, 0.6051803231239319, 0.8203828930854797, 0.26276323199272156, 0.7771511077880859, 0.608185350894928, 0.9274627566337585, 0.5640203356742859, 0.4837063252925873, 0.9398201704025269, 0.7415887117385864, 0.8891193866729736, 0.286413311958313, 0.7988719940185547, 0.8523169755935669, 0.7584574818611145, 0.7788705229759216, 0.8528657555580139, 0.7401029467582703, 0.6487119197845459, 0.6110397577285767, 0.4034000337123871, 0.8639873266220093, 0.7366685271263123, 0.7752134203910828, 0.7714868783950806, 0.6626608371734619, 0.7946629524230957, 0.8045839667320251, 0.6688504815101624, 0.8065423965454102, 0.7631751894950867, 0.5818480849266052, 0.46941325068473816, 0.7801547050476074, 0.46000733971595764, 0.9463580846786499, 0.47195109724998474, 0.9311087727546692, 0.6194740533828735, 0.48058202862739563, 0.5439863204956055, 0.9216460585594177, 0.8370386958122253, 0.3359057903289795, 0.7466074228286743, 0.9132824540138245, 0.6400056481361389, 0.7835394144058228, 0.7229162454605103, 0.8917173743247986, 0.8571438789367676, 0.8019211888313293, 0.7139522433280945, 0.8190969228744507, 0.7967138886451721, 0.808449923992157]]"," percent of the total Saudi exports in 2012.
Al-Ayed said the SIDF has adopted an aggressive industrial development plan to boost the exports of Saudi Arabia's industrial products.
He said the plan currently under implementation involves building several industrial parks, setting up a port for exports and investing in the construction of a new refinery by the end of 2017.
Al-Ayed said the initiative to improve the infrastructure of the SIDF is also a priority.
He said the SIDF is currently working on several industrial projects, including one to develop a smart factory with the aim of transforming traditional manufacturing into a modern sector.
The SIDF chief said the authority is also working on several industrial parks to enhance the competitiveness of the industrial sectorInitiation of the SIDF industrial development plan was presented in the Sultanate in October 2010."," percent of Saudi export revenues between 2012-14 while automotive engineering accounted 44 percent of export revenues between 2012-14 to 2012 levels while those related to agriculture accounted 23rd and 13ths in recent periods, he noted
The global petroleum prices, however, are now on course to decline from current $100 to a future lower than $75 while there is a risk of deflation globally because of inflation, he added
Al-Ayed pointed out that the SADCF is working to expand a network of industrial parks to provide access to energy at competitive prices, especially to the petrostates of Saudi Gulf countries, to help them diversification their industries away from hydrocars and to reduce import requirements of raw raw petrostuffs and petrostates of these countries to help them cope if future prices of petroleum are to drop further to bring them near zero

9232,"Although the case has not advanced to the point where he’s assigned it to prosecutors, Campbell said there was a good chance Cappleman, who is one of four top prosecutors in his office, could have been involved.
But Campbell said the conflict wouldn’t prevent other prosecutors at the office from prosecuting Latvala.
“There’s no conflict,” Campbell said.
Latvala, 66, was at the pinnacle of his power as Senate budget chairman until allegations of sexual harassment, first reported by Politico, surfaced in November.
The Senate initiated two investigations, including hiring retired Judge Ronald Swanson to serve as special master. On Dec. 19, Swanson found probable cause that Latvala had violated Senate misconduct rules and sexually harassed a legislative aide. Swanson also said that Latvala may have violated state corruption laws by seeking sexual intimacy with a lobbyist in exchange for legislative favors.
Investigators, led by the head of FDLE’s executive investigations team, Scott McInerney, have still not reached out to key players, including Latvala and the lobbyist, Laura McLeod, lawyers for both said Tuesday.
Around the time the harassment"," allegations surfaced, Latvala hired Chaires, a former Leon County sheriff’s deputy, according to Latvala’s attorney, Steven R. Andrews.
Chaires, who owns Warrior Security Contractors, did not turn up any listening devices, he said.
Andrews noted that the work was completed before any potential criminal charges had emerged. Chaires was paid the $645 — not even a full day’s work for a typical investigator — on Dec. 11, nine days before Latvala resigned.

1387,"Premera Blue Cross Cyberattack Exposed Millions Of Customer Records : All Tech Considered The health insurance provider has revealed that a cyberattack discovered in January may have made the medical and financial information of 11 million people vulnerable to thieves.
Another big health insurance company has revealed it has been the target of a massive cyberattack.
Premera Blue Cross says hackers may have taken up to 11 million customer records. Those records include credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, even information about medical problems. This news is just coming out but Premera issued a statement saying it discovered the breach on Jan. 29. That's about the same date that Anthem, another Blue Cross company, told the FBI that it was breached.
It's possible that Anthem put the word out and, given the timelines, the attacks were related — done by the same perpetrator. At least that's an educated guess from the cybersecurity company iSight Partners.
Premera also says the attack itself started in May of last year. But iSight found a suspicious domain called ""prennera.com,"" an address that may have been made to spoof Premera's official website. It was created in December 2013.
Either way, that's many, many months to steal people's data. NPR has reported previously on the black market for credit cards and health records. Will a bunch of for-sale signs go up there? Probably not this time — or at least that's according to sources who hang out in the underground.
Health care data can be more valuable than credit card information on the black market. But so far, sources say, the Anthem data hasn't shown up on the underground sites. And Premera may not either. It could be that the hackers are not run-of-the-mill criminals, but in it for cyber-espionage.
Yes, cyber-espionage. As in spies. It's possible that a nation-state actor is involved.
Both health care companies are huge providers with lots of government workers. So if someone wants intel on Defense Department employees — where they live, spouses' names, serious (or embarrassing) medical conditions, a breach is a way to stockpile that data and use it for blackmail later.
As iSight malware analyst Brian Bartholomew says: ""The sole purpose of espionage is to steal information, gain advantage. By publicizing, you're giving up the leverage you have.""
NPR has asked Premera and the FBI whether they are alerting other health care providers to watch out or providing details other companies might benefit from. Neither has immediately responded to our inquiry.
There's another group called the National Healthcare ISAC (Information-sharing"," and Analysis Center) that helps to share breach information. They say they've been in contact with private investigators at Mandiant as well as federal investigators handling the case. So far, the specific ways that Premera was attacked — like the IP addresses the attacks came from or the specific types of malware — have not been declassified and shared with other potential targets.
Director Deborah Kobza says in an email, ""It is only through coordinated sector and cross-sector cybersecurity information sharing, that we, as a nation, can move critical infrastructure cybersecurity protection from a reactive to proactive stance.""
But what is Premera doing to protect victims — the up to 11 million people who may be affected here? Premera says it is offering two years of free credit monitoring. It's the same kind of protection that retailers and financial institutions have given victims of credit card hacking. But if the point of this theft is altogether different, espionage, then identity monitoring doesn't really help in the end.",753,553,200,15.562984228134155,61.894219636917114,"[[0.6023683547973633, 0.7401314973831177, 0.25088736414909363, 0.9365798234939575, 0.7425202131271362, 0.6695696711540222, 0.48533129692077637, 0.4724422097206116, 0.7866826057434082, 0.5064777731895447, 0.5132125616073608, 0.731016218662262, 0.44122830033302307, 0.2948278784751892, 0.448959618806839, 0.8689125776290894, 0.6369348168373108, 0.7979341149330139, 0.4962961971759796, 0.6278152465820312, 0.8698393702507019, 0.7142693400382996, 0.5065897107124329, 0.4900501072406769, 0.7094911336898804, 0.6783879399299622, 0.505815863609314, 0.37026917934417725, 0.7575945854187012, 0.660370409488678, 0.8882343173027039, 0.9309015274047852, 0.605965256690979, 0.8757367730140686, 0.8920765519142151, 0.42893412709236145, 0.6943928003311157, 0.8816394209861755, 0.8549502491950989, 0.6040983200073242, 0.4453352093696594, 0.7294561862945557, 0.73079514503479, 0.527907133102417, 0.5239761471748352, 0.5824968814849854, 0.7375907301902771, 0.6611353158950806, 0.7836580872535706, 0.5285604000091553, 0.6176288723945618, 0.4393731951713562, 0.8413106203079224, 0.7943702936172485, 0.3184760808944702, 0.4510226547718048, 0.4365825057029724, 0.6545066833496094, 0.2717497944831848, 0.8488063812255859, 0.9213876724243164, 0.5286366939544678, 0.6315436959266663, 0.37280917167663574, 0.9219029545783997, 0.38911253213882446, 0.934407651424408, 0.7788185477256775, 0.6614176630973816, 0.6047791242599487, 0.28884077072143555, 0.48504137992858887, 0.5503497123718262, 0.25434377789497375, 0.9338850975036621, 0.36967548727989197, 0.3068147599697113, 0.45988279581069946, 0.2838295102119446, 0.304460734128952, 0.7949364185333252, 0.6575432419776917, 0.3450232446193695, 0.2906809449195862, 0.6330981850624084, 0.612143337726593, 0.2569471299648285, 0.443050354719162, 0.3896932601928711, 0.33553364872932434, 0.2710219919681549, 0.2614355981349945, 0.3781239986419678, 0.3826298713684082, 0.25172507762908936, 0.4637499749660492, 0.31782859563827515, 0.2805178165435791, 0.25735223293304443, 0.254767507314682, 0.27827170491218567, 0.2706950306892395, 0.25099053978919983, 0.41663092374801636, 0.2855071425437927, 0.2652641534805298, 0.2548101246356964, 0.25282660126686096, 0.2597189247608185, 0.2555830180644989, 0.25093743205070496, 0.349784255027771, 0.27037277817726135, 0.2599274516105652, 0.25371813774108887, 0.2517853379249573, 0.25521937012672424, 0.2528853118419647, 0.2510627508163452, 0.31777647137641907, 0.2622842490673065, 0.2574485242366791, 0.2532130777835846, 0.2511376738548279, 0.2536543309688568, 0.25209513306617737, 0.2511982321739197, 0.29945582151412964, 0.2580108642578125, 0.25606611371040344, 0.2528494596481323, 0.25077417492866516, 0.25272485613822937, 0.25179973244667053, 0.25141769647598267, 0.28366222977638245, 0.2558848261833191, 0.25529494881629944, 0.2525608539581299, 0.2505304515361786, 0.2522914409637451, 0.25156134366989136, 0.25161445140838623, 0.2788574993610382, 0.2549797594547272, 0.25487351417541504, 0.25231972336769104, 0.2504124045372009, 0.2522038221359253, 0.2513911724090576, 0.25176188349723816, 0.27170678973197937, 0.25423064827919006, 0.25491440296173096, 0.2521101236343384, 0.25038862228393555, 0.25221478939056396, 0.2513013184070587, 0.25195279717445374, 0.26841971278190613, 0.2537347078323364, 0.2546245753765106, 0.2521035373210907, 0.25035354495048523, 0.2522834837436676, 0.25126153230667114, 0.2521660327911377, 0.2653641998767853, 0.2534640431404114, 0.25435587763786316, 0.252054363489151, 0.25034433603286743, 0.2523587942123413, 0.2512736916542053, 0.2524326741695404, 0.26395949721336365, 0.25322020053863525, 0.2544446587562561, 0.25214746594429016, 0.2503332793712616, 0.2525159418582916, 0.25118014216423035, 0.2525022029876709, 0.2648710310459137, 0.25304487347602844, 0.2546098828315735, 0.2522714138031006, 0.25032493472099304, 0.25257134437561035, 0.2511691749095917, 0.25266140699386597, 0.26480549573898315, 0.2529904246330261, 0.25468435883522034, 0.25229567289352417, 0.25033697485923767, 0.25255846977233887, 0.2510095536708832, 0.2528866231441498, 0.2633754014968872]]"," and Analysis Center) that has been working with the industry for years.

3190,"China's central bank says fighting inflation will receive higher priority this year, raising the possibility of more rate hikes at a time when other major economies are trying to boost growth.
The announcement late Thursday follows repeated pledges by Beijing to cool inflation that jumped to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November. Communist leaders worry that sharp rises in living costs might trigger unrest.
""Stabilizing price levels will receive more prominent status,"" the People's Bank of China said in a report after an annual planning meeting. The bank said it will ""effectively manage liquidity and control financial conditions that might cause excessive price increases.""
Chinese stocks declined in early trading Friday after the announcement but the main index rebounded to positive territory by late morning.
The inflation surge highlights the contrast between China, which rebounded quickly from the global crisis and is trying to restore normal financial conditions, and the United States and struggling European economies.
Higher interest rates could further slow China's growth, possibly cutting its demand for factory machinery, industrial components, iron ore and other imports from the United States, Europe, Australia and its Asian neighbors.
China's rapid expansion slowed to"," 9.6 percent in the three months ending in September, down from 10.3 percent the previous quarter, though still the highest of any major economy. Analysts expect that to slow further this year as Beijing clamps down on credit and steers growth to a more sustainable level.
Analysts blame the price rises on the flood of bank lending that helped China ward off the global downturn. Inflation so far is limited mostly to food, but analysts say price pressures will spread unless Beijing raises interest rates further and tightens access to credit.
Inflation has been well above the government's target of 3 percent since late last year and some analysts expect it to rise further in December and January.
The central bank has raised interest rates twice in the past three months, most recently on Christmas Day. Many analysts expect more increases this year.
Chinese leaders ordered a shift in monetary policy from easy credit to a ""prudent monetary policy"" in 2011 in a planning report issued last month.",434,234,200,22.834776639938354,58.73031044006348,"[[0.6546347737312317, 0.30202800035476685, 0.5076932311058044, 0.462962806224823, 0.25866127014160156, 0.3073211908340454, 0.7386173605918884, 0.2801256477832794, 0.42431774735450745, 0.7089770436286926, 0.34114548563957214, 0.2523799240589142, 0.5587096214294434, 0.8723414540290833, 0.25015988945961, 0.2509406507015228, 0.2818322479724884, 0.6832859516143799, 0.5115387439727783, 0.7379179000854492, 0.2923654019832611, 0.7552216053009033, 0.2602408826351166, 0.8530718088150024, 0.28424522280693054, 0.6332830786705017, 0.254029780626297, 0.696523904800415, 0.3380749225616455, 0.385572612285614, 0.42287275195121765, 0.8176888227462769, 0.2632586359977722, 0.6039678454399109, 0.6369019150733948, 0.6723953485488892, 0.31749990582466125, 0.8790469169616699, 0.883033812046051, 0.25079306960105896, 0.25319474935531616, 0.2968684136867523, 0.6635127663612366, 0.5440833568572998, 0.7338188290596008, 0.8807142376899719, 0.7165572643280029, 0.916984498500824, 0.6700266003608704, 0.5042577385902405, 0.7114659547805786, 0.8182597756385803, 0.8853845596313477, 0.39290037751197815, 0.853822648525238, 0.6633555293083191, 0.7385092973709106, 0.944120466709137, 0.43715450167655945, 0.6542761921882629, 0.627493143081665, 0.2525007128715515, 0.7553181052207947, 0.4996291399002075, 0.4550924301147461, 0.3473021388053894, 0.9109721183776855, 0.4650614261627197, 0.8054680824279785, 0.6105393767356873, 0.6845608353614807, 0.5728539228439331, 0.8873000741004944, 0.653769850730896, 0.8246200084686279, 0.4836757779121399, 0.7928515076637268, 0.5232333540916443, 0.5262805223464966, 0.4903213679790497, 0.9359424710273743, 0.7319546937942505, 0.46009114384651184, 0.4233989417552948, 0.2519092261791229, 0.5297825336456299, 0.5448628664016724, 0.5467079877853394, 0.9487112760543823, 0.49559348821640015, 0.9217076301574707, 0.26678138971328735, 0.33861273527145386, 0.4416692554950714, 0.41818293929100037, 0.3960772454738617, 0.9264523983001709, 0.5173976421356201, 0.34138214588165283, 0.8500192165374756, 0.6131907105445862, 0.5032966136932373, 0.32469457387924194, 0.43960869312286377, 0.33574339747428894, 0.5641241073608398, 0.8053708672523499, 0.3559942841529846, 0.9190839529037476, 0.6816559433937073, 0.8665462136268616, 0.9663011431694031, 0.39278459548950195, 0.42739322781562805, 0.6188225150108337, 0.3415204882621765, 0.6951677203178406, 0.7989219427108765, 0.2550249397754669, 0.580065906047821, 0.7080996036529541, 0.669830858707428, 0.5953831076622009, 0.6925957202911377, 0.7286239862442017, 0.7833176851272583, 0.42011648416519165, 0.8473974466323853, 0.6513325572013855, 0.7531237602233887, 0.6407385468482971, 0.45747944712638855, 0.40613195300102234, 0.44877690076828003, 0.8589434623718262, 0.9291477203369141, 0.2512671947479248, 0.2542654871940613, 0.4115866720676422, 0.4124240577220917, 0.25995221734046936, 0.2683532238006592, 0.25671014189720154, 0.2514910399913788, 0.25266745686531067, 0.2504553496837616, 0.25040391087532043, 0.25104400515556335, 0.252564936876297, 0.25238916277885437, 0.25078752636909485, 0.2516206204891205, 0.2736898958683014, 0.2555258572101593, 0.25227540731430054, 0.25192025303840637, 0.2517458498477936, 0.273425817489624, 0.2538231909275055, 0.252981960773468, 0.25136083364486694, 0.25230950117111206, 0.2597968280315399, 0.25352463126182556, 0.25034019351005554, 0.260773628950119, 0.2518293261528015, 0.2512093484401703, 0.25082841515541077, 0.2527454197406769, 0.2514615058898926, 0.25515198707580566, 0.2559357285499573, 0.2519141435623169, 0.2555445432662964, 0.25208404660224915, 0.2633470594882965, 0.26117876172065735, 0.25555285811424255, 0.2537822723388672, 0.2987486720085144, 0.3816681504249573, 0.2583059072494507, 0.27604955434799194, 0.27333828806877136, 0.2510610520839691, 0.2509823739528656, 0.254061222076416, 0.28670671582221985, 0.2526644766330719, 0.25717881321907043, 0.25173524022102356, 0.2509821057319641, 0.2554323673248291, 0.2598293423652649, 0.2501462399959564, 0.2630922794342041, 0.2501412630081177, 0.2502768933773041, 0.2501237094402313]]"," 7.2 percent over a year earlier in the July-September quarter, the weakest pace since the first quarter of 2009.

In its report, the central bank said that ""economic stability is the most important task,"" and that ""the main task of monetary policy this year is to ensure stable and sustainable economic growth.""
The bank said that it would ""strengthen market supervision of financial institutions and ensure adequate liquidity.""
The central bank said it would ""actively implement tax reform"" while ""doubling down"" on efforts to cut ""excessive and inefficient"" government spending. It said it would also ""adopt more targeted fiscal and monetary policies to effectively meet the needs of the growth-oriented development.""

5360,"JUST a month after coming into power, the Zifa board have been rocked by a tsunami with vice-president Gift Banda being suspended yesterday following a meeting of the game's leaders held in the capital.
The Bulawayo-based football administrator, who was a runaway winner in the battle for the Zifa vice-presidency, was suspended for allegedly reshuffling the Warriors technical team without the blessing of his boss, Felton Kamambo, and other board members.
Banda, who was Zifa acting president when he announced that Rahman Gumbo and Lloyd Mutasa had been relieved of their duties and replaced by Bongani Mafu and Tonderai Ndiraya, was said to have acted beyond the jurisdiction of his authority.
In arguments presented to his fellow board members yesterday, Banda said he felt his role as the acting president empowered him to make such decisions.
He even suggested that if what he did was out of line with the constitution, then the board had the power to reverse the appointments and stick with the old Warriors technical set-up.
Kamambo was out of the country in Senegal for the Caf awards at the time.
The appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu had to be ratified at the Zifa board meeting which was held yesterday but things quickly took a nasty turn when Banda was asked to leave the room while other board members discussed the issue. While the board could have merely chosen not to ratify the appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu, if they felt they had not been done according to their constitution, they decided that punitive measures should be meted on the Zifa vice-president.
The matter was taken to a vote and four of the seven remaining members voted for Banda to be suspended, pending the confirmation of his suspension by the Zifa Council at the association's annual meeting in March, while three voted for him to be retained as the vice-president.
Ironically, Banda, who received 35 votes from Councillors in a strong showing in his successful battle to become the Zifa vice-president just a month ago, had"," his fate sealed by just four votes from his fellow board members.
Interestingly, a margin of one vote was all that mattered for him to be suspended from his post and he becomes the first Zifa vice-president to meet such a fate since Kenny Marange was also kicked out of the board by the leadership of Cuthbert Dube eight years ago.
It's the first time that a Zifa vice-president, the second most powerful man in the management of the game in the country, has been booted out after just one month.
Zifa boss Kamambo had, interestingly, told the domestic football family that his leadership will not suspend any of the board members because he felt such a system crippled the operations of the leadership of the game. However, things changed dramatically yesterday when Banda was shown the red card by his fellow board members just one month after coming into office.
Banda refused to comment on the developments yesterday saying he will release a comprehensive response in due course.",633,433,200,24.95737385749817,60.55777907371521,"[[0.9278334379196167, 0.8708639144897461, 0.8094038963317871, 0.7902323007583618, 0.9024615287780762, 0.3607921600341797, 0.7621803283691406, 0.7062166333198547, 0.5457601547241211, 0.6866247653961182, 0.9455647468566895, 0.8592113852500916, 0.7207068204879761, 0.8206138014793396, 0.751889705657959, 0.5868549346923828, 0.5116230845451355, 0.6193991899490356, 0.6655670404434204, 0.3973785638809204, 0.514521598815918, 0.9592489004135132, 0.2523815333843231, 0.4664841592311859, 0.7587375044822693, 0.6094915270805359, 0.4243623614311218, 0.8398631811141968, 0.5077472925186157, 0.25603312253952026, 0.3652634024620056, 0.9375134110450745, 0.4160066246986389, 0.2747459411621094, 0.9485082626342773, 0.7731192708015442, 0.7573241591453552, 0.9239184260368347, 0.4027356207370758, 0.7545024156570435, 0.7758216857910156, 0.5079230666160583, 0.43530136346817017, 0.9361616373062134, 0.6850293874740601, 0.5591182112693787, 0.7608790397644043, 0.7420306205749512, 0.48084884881973267, 0.9319837689399719, 0.765299379825592, 0.617783784866333, 0.9385941028594971, 0.5687100887298584, 0.8677749037742615, 0.7316354513168335, 0.2604902684688568, 0.9295006394386292, 0.5362025499343872, 0.2533057630062103, 0.25097236037254333, 0.3984600305557251, 0.8516498804092407, 0.8443138599395752, 0.5471736788749695, 0.2785087525844574, 0.4634866416454315, 0.3315419852733612, 0.6674080491065979, 0.46788084506988525, 0.8136060833930969, 0.6218953728675842, 0.3344196081161499, 0.8159739971160889, 0.684004008769989, 0.3425601124763489, 0.8635273575782776, 0.3595399260520935, 0.6158106327056885, 0.2679564654827118, 0.929843008518219, 0.9795722365379333, 0.8684024810791016, 0.8425067663192749, 0.4976937770843506, 0.931220531463623, 0.3882072865962982, 0.6195621490478516, 0.8184472322463989, 0.46348002552986145, 0.25693434476852417, 0.2532929480075836, 0.4932343661785126, 0.7182016968727112, 0.8000951409339905, 0.7989059090614319, 0.45381253957748413, 0.5886744260787964, 0.26405447721481323, 0.250160813331604, 0.25254109501838684, 0.4874914884567261, 0.904843807220459, 0.38214364647865295, 0.5536060929298401, 0.8899713754653931, 0.5118210911750793, 0.9483333826065063, 0.39154383540153503, 0.2738725543022156, 0.5562527179718018, 0.27064386010169983, 0.25063905119895935, 0.2558545768260956, 0.5571377873420715, 0.6336318850517273, 0.633640706539154, 0.7047585248947144, 0.9633374810218811, 0.8141469359397888, 0.27402612566947937, 0.5836192965507507, 0.8505038619041443, 0.7712262272834778, 0.7495896220207214, 0.338786780834198, 0.35331523418426514, 0.4648888409137726, 0.7797213792800903, 0.298113614320755, 0.7560145258903503, 0.6713826060295105, 0.41563746333122253, 0.8862947821617126, 0.891444742679596, 0.8832998275756836, 0.7528549432754517, 0.8430293202400208, 0.6276890635490417, 0.7113663554191589, 0.7103479504585266, 0.29537877440452576, 0.8284804821014404, 0.5975826382637024, 0.3763783872127533, 0.28452759981155396, 0.7144547700881958, 0.37283462285995483, 0.26891028881073, 0.37899136543273926, 0.5939739346504211, 0.8830138444900513, 0.8863895535469055, 0.27560481429100037, 0.8349118232727051, 0.7412542700767517, 0.48840653896331787, 0.4976859390735626, 0.4937158226966858, 0.2608742117881775, 0.6164841651916504, 0.8645150661468506, 0.6412725448608398, 0.8210870027542114, 0.6924918293952942, 0.7566056847572327, 0.909817099571228, 0.25038695335388184, 0.2509407103061676, 0.25672799348831177, 0.25167256593704224, 0.44900456070899963, 0.5573158264160156, 0.3735952079296112, 0.25065749883651733, 0.25272881984710693, 0.8021714091300964, 0.5890702605247498, 0.3976162075996399, 0.2504091262817383, 0.5817741751670837, 0.2507350444793701, 0.25013840198516846, 0.25173941254615784, 0.842940092086792, 0.6783854961395264, 0.25958165526390076, 0.25201448798179626, 0.7821919322013855, 0.8167887330055237, 0.8205512166023254, 0.7030974626541138, 0.2829510271549225, 0.6411989331245422, 0.7684682011604309, 0.6581107974052429, 0.5174817442893982, 0.3334035277366638, 0.4022562801837921, 0.2776376008987427]]"," earlier made it clear that he had no intention of contesting the position.

1180,"TLC member says she'll stream Supernova on Web site to meet self-imposed deadline.
To quote Sunshine Anderson, we've ""heard it all before.""
After years of talk and no delivery, nobody should be surprised that Arista has announced it will push back the in-store date for Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes' solo debut, Supernova, from summer to fall.
However, the self-proclaimed ""crazy"" of TLC said she'll have her music out to the people on August 16 by hook or by crook.
""I picked the 16th as the release date because something weird happened in my family,"" she explained. ""My father died and his father was born on August 16. And January 31 was the day that he was born and his father died. So they came in and out on each other's dates, and they were both 40 when they died.""
Left Eye is so adamant about the album coming out next week that she said she'll stream the album's 13 tracks on her Web site (www.eyenetics.com) starting at 12:01 a.m. on that fateful day. She's getting support from the label online; an Arista spokesperson said the tracks will also be streamed on parent company BMG's click2music.com.
""It's a very significant release date for me,"" Left Eye said. ""It was something that has been sitting in the back of my mind for a couple of years now like, 'Wow, I wonder what that means?' There's magic in those numbers for me, because 162001 equals 10, which in numerology is symbolic of a star, and the album is called Supernova. It all ties in. It's a conceptual thing but there's a deep meaning buried in it. Everything has a double meaning.""
A fair share of stars guest on the album. Look for appearances by Carl Thomas, Esthero, Blaque and Tupac Shakur.
""The track with Tupac is titled 'Untouchable,' and it speaks for itself,"" Left Eye said. ""Tupac and everything about him is untouchable to me. I didn't record the song with him. I got a copy of the song and his lyrics were on the track. If you want to talk about whether I recorded it before or after his death, I can't answer that. It's still a mystery to me.""
Left Eye said she asks about the mysteries of life, and the mysteries of Pac's life, on the track.
""I'm basically asking him to answer those questions for me,"" she said. ""In the third verse he gives me his view from the other side. Some of the song's lyrics are so heavy. He says things like, 'You remember me legendary, I live eternally.' He produced the song. It's dynamite to me because he isn't"," known as a producer. It's like a double whammy because I get a song produced by Tupac  a song featuring him that actually features me. I'm featured on a Tupac song on my album.""
As to why Arista has decided to push back the album's release after confirming it would be out on August 14 a month ago (see ""Left Eye Delivering Solo Supernova... Finally""), a label spokesperson said Arista wanted Left Eye to record more tracks for the album as well as lay vocals for the new TLC disc. The spokesperson added that Lopes would promote her album overseas during breaks in recording between now and October.
The first video from Supernova is the Hype Williams-directed ""Block Party,"" which should air any day. The video depicts Left Eye dancing with children on a computer-generated neighborhood block.
All three members of TLC are in the studio, and Arista said their album should come out before the end of the year.",793,593,200,26.913589000701904,61.806273460388184,"[[0.8954629302024841, 0.7682576179504395, 0.5129591822624207, 0.698494553565979, 0.3908713161945343, 0.5596427917480469, 0.7035279870033264, 0.9059820175170898, 0.6478046178817749, 0.8652330040931702, 0.9333717226982117, 0.9028279781341553, 0.6171830892562866, 0.37257954478263855, 0.737667441368103, 0.5639410018920898, 0.6151514649391174, 0.7199511528015137, 0.30733051896095276, 0.7607348561286926, 0.5530201196670532, 0.7714161276817322, 0.8380624651908875, 0.709962010383606, 0.812580406665802, 0.5494953989982605, 0.7431052923202515, 0.9178193807601929, 0.2614813446998596, 0.26769185066223145, 0.5158600211143494, 0.4453745484352112, 0.46791017055511475, 0.8468786478042603, 0.8133259415626526, 0.6558451652526855, 0.8069145083427429, 0.6262920498847961, 0.8971368074417114, 0.594190239906311, 0.5889759659767151, 0.5307155847549438, 0.6482144594192505, 0.6340130567550659, 0.35707512497901917, 0.29784783720970154, 0.28000563383102417, 0.5571114420890808, 0.4218803942203522, 0.3189815580844879, 0.2838982343673706, 0.2628543972969055, 0.47145482897758484, 0.3313620388507843, 0.2857153117656708, 0.2774241864681244, 0.2595047950744629, 0.40697988867759705, 0.2780085504055023, 0.26429665088653564, 0.2720832824707031, 0.25837063789367676, 0.37742578983306885, 0.2602831721305847, 0.2559630870819092, 0.26764625310897827, 0.25748687982559204, 0.3588419258594513, 0.254631370306015, 0.2527920603752136, 0.2638118267059326, 0.25686630606651306, 0.34616509079933167, 0.25271886587142944, 0.2516067326068878, 0.260772168636322, 0.2565303146839142, 0.330557644367218, 0.251797616481781, 0.25113144516944885, 0.2593127489089966, 0.2561435103416443, 0.31969162821769714, 0.25135791301727295, 0.2509502172470093, 0.25856301188468933, 0.25576820969581604, 0.31141406297683716, 0.2510780990123749, 0.25087082386016846, 0.2580679655075073, 0.25537729263305664, 0.30879712104797363, 0.25089526176452637, 0.25080984830856323, 0.25747889280319214, 0.255080908536911, 0.3065945506095886, 0.2507828176021576, 0.25070488452911377, 0.25717484951019287, 0.2548403739929199, 0.30314362049102783, 0.2507120966911316, 0.25063544511795044, 0.25647205114364624, 0.25461873412132263, 0.29615893959999084, 0.25062453746795654, 0.25057128071784973, 0.25586622953414917, 0.25419920682907104, 0.28960931301116943, 0.2505500018596649, 0.2505205571651459, 0.2551518380641937, 0.2537713944911957, 0.2834911048412323, 0.2504974901676178, 0.2504834234714508, 0.2544694244861603, 0.25345364212989807, 0.2782275378704071, 0.25043535232543945, 0.2504638135433197, 0.25390878319740295, 0.253078430891037, 0.27378708124160767, 0.2503855228424072, 0.25043487548828125, 0.253451943397522, 0.2527581751346588, 0.2710847854614258, 0.25035667419433594, 0.2504114508628845, 0.2531139850616455, 0.252572625875473, 0.26993528008461, 0.25033748149871826, 0.25037872791290283, 0.25294962525367737, 0.25227171182632446, 0.2695336639881134, 0.25033411383628845, 0.25035855174064636, 0.2527697682380676, 0.25195834040641785, 0.26829683780670166, 0.2503223121166229, 0.25033774971961975, 0.2524520754814148, 0.2515687048435211, 0.2661585509777069, 0.2503117024898529, 0.2503150701522827, 0.25214463472366333, 0.25143328309059143, 0.2642069160938263, 0.25029462575912476, 0.250291109085083, 0.25192391872406006, 0.2513819932937622, 0.26356741786003113, 0.25028160214424133, 0.2502896189689636, 0.2516971528530121, 0.25140953063964844, 0.26277345418930054, 0.25027206540107727, 0.2502864897251129, 0.2515798807144165, 0.251515656709671, 0.2613258361816406, 0.25025704503059387, 0.25028204917907715, 0.25150638818740845, 0.2516331672668457, 0.25962769985198975, 0.25025224685668945, 0.25028741359710693, 0.2514239549636841, 0.2517113983631134, 0.25803831219673157, 0.25024133920669556, 0.2502762973308563, 0.2513676583766937, 0.2517509460449219, 0.2575443983078003, 0.2502351403236389, 0.25027310848236084, 0.25126421451568604, 0.2518308758735657, 0.2570418417453766, 0.25022947788238525, 0.2502581775188446, 0.25123846530914307, 0.25180721282958984, 0.2563859820365906, 0.2502240240573883, 0.25024887919425964]]"," just saying it.

Description:

In this episode, we’ll take a look at the supposed “Amateur Hacker-Robot”. We’ll see what it’s capabilities are and how you can use them to make your own robot.

We’ll also take a look at the “The Inner Circle” as well, a group of hackers who are working together to create the perfect android. The idea is to create an android that can be controlled by a human, and yet still be programmed to"," refine the artificial limbs moves, a la the latest hit movie about robot-dancer, Zombeast
The researchers said they don't plan a followup film though because they don't think a sequel is necessary to explain how it all came together so well; just look at how all of Hollywood is now remakes anyway; just the other night there was Zombeast and Sharknadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadadad",200,200,0.10886470675468445,0.28531018376350403,"{'num_tokens_scored': 80, 'num_green_tokens': 80, 'green_fraction': 1.0, 'z_score': 15.491933384829666, 'p_value': 1.966416589674257e-54, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

2417,"In a 53-page document filed quietly last week with environmental regulators and made public Tuesday, sweeping changes are detailed in the state’s highway tolling infrastructure and policies – including a program to charge tolls on the Tobin Bridge for northbound and southbound traffic.
The document – published in the insider-only ‘Environmental Monitor’ – details the new All-Electronic Tolling System (AETS) implementation project, a project addressed in some measure through meetings held in Chelsea and other municipalities earlier this summer. It’s a project Gov. Deval Patrick has pushed since day one, eliminating cash toll collection booths and going to an all-electronic system. It would be the largest toll road electronic conversion project in the nation to date, if approved.
While the document made public this week is concerned mostly with environmental aspects of the project, many key details in the tolling plan emerged concerning the Tobin Bridge and harbor tunnels (Ted Williams, Callahan, Sumner and I-90 Boston Extension).
One of the major changes for the Tobin and harbor tunnels includes adding tolling locations for northbound traffic. Currently, all northbound traffic out of Boston on the Bridge and tunnels pays no toll. Under the new plan, AETS gateways would be added for northbound and southbound traffic – meaning that a person going into Boston from Chelsea or other points north would be charged going in and coming out.
There was no word in the document about whether Chelsea’s host community discount would continue for the Bridge, which would be a key question for those living in Chelsea. That said, state transportation officials have certainly had their sights set on eliminating such discounts systemwide for the last several years. That, however, will be a conversation for a different day and likely something that local leaders will have to fight for.
The toll booths on the Tobin would be demolished under the plan, and new AETS gateways would be stretched over the southbound roadway after the Bridge and just before the exit splits (Rutherford Ave. or 93 South) in Charlestown.
Later, a northbound tolling gateway is proposed to stretch across the northbound roadway just prior to the entrance to the Bridge tunnel, also in Charlestown.
The southbound Tobin AETS gateway would actually end up being the Pilot Program for the new technology – being implemented next year as a test for the systemwide change that is proposed for 2015.
The system would work via the EZ Pass electronic collection method that many already use. Statistics in the filing showed that 68 percent of tolls at the Bridge and harbor tunnels in 2012 were collected via the EZ Pass. For those who do not or cannot convert to the EZ Pass system, photos of a person’s license plate will be taken at each toll gateway and an invoice will be sent on a monthly basis to the owner of that plate. The state has already worked out a system of enforcement with other states to collect unpaid tolls from out-of-state placeholders. Similarly, those in-state placeholders who do not pay the invoices would be subject to fines and Registry withholdings.
For those in Chelsea who use the Ted Williams Tunnel or the Callahan Tunnel, there would be a major change and with no possible savings via the host discount. The northbound Callahan Tunnel and the northbound side of the Ted Williams Tunnel also will begin charging a toll – a movement that is now free as tolls are only charged for those coming into Boston.
“The Metropolitan Highway System (MHS) Williams Tunnel currently collects tolls in two nearby westbound (inbound) plazas by Logan Airport,” read the filing. “These structures will be retained, but cash collection booths and equipment will be removed. Also, this tunnel will be converted from one-way to two-way tolling, with the addition of an AETS toll zone for eastbound traffic. Rates will be modified to reflect the change in tolls by collection in both directions.
While the filing indicated modified rates for only the Williams Tunnel due to two-way tolling, it did not specify what kind of rate modification, and it mentioned no rate modifications for two-way tolling at the Tobin Bridge and Sumner/Callahan crossings.
All in"," all, 18 new gated toll locations would be added to the system to accompany the existing 24 locations.
While most of the locations are in Western and Central Massachusetts on the Mass Pike and are designed to reduce traffic congestion and the “ticket” toll system, the moves on the Boston Pike Extension and the Bridge/Harbor Tunnels would be huge changes.
Many local and state officials had no idea of the dramatic changes detailed in the filing until told by the newspaper, and all deferred comment until they could find out more information on the extensive plan.
Key members in the Legislature, however, tended to think the DOT was taking the half-a-loaf approach – asking for the full loaf in hopes of getting a half-loaf or even just a slice of bread.
Such changes can be implemented without Legislative approval – requiring only that Commissioners approve it. However, such a change would cost millions and that kind of appropriation would need to be approved by the State Legislature.",1086,886,200,29.638673543930054,64.8949658870697,"[[0.341858834028244, 0.4024601876735687, 0.31531190872192383, 0.32699093222618103, 0.6566475033760071, 0.8741533756256104, 0.4690711796283722, 0.395946204662323, 0.5753305554389954, 0.9189627170562744, 0.3154773414134979, 0.8041859865188599, 0.7843942642211914, 0.8592475652694702, 0.7861561179161072, 0.7640559673309326, 0.8288785815238953, 0.8608844876289368, 0.26122838258743286, 0.3527784049510956, 0.5324848294258118, 0.46433931589126587, 0.8669888973236084, 0.2539829611778259, 0.7891752123832703, 0.4439321458339691, 0.8939919471740723, 0.9064186811447144, 0.7677477598190308, 0.8623568415641785, 0.8567165732383728, 0.911624014377594, 0.8427135944366455, 0.9148187041282654, 0.8740366697311401, 0.6214436292648315, 0.8489733934402466, 0.9190297722816467, 0.28199419379234314, 0.8976002931594849, 0.8313353657722473, 0.5586217641830444, 0.9109270572662354, 0.8407297134399414, 0.5517966151237488, 0.35496076941490173, 0.5695606470108032, 0.73542320728302, 0.5696712732315063, 0.3589983880519867, 0.6155425310134888, 0.6854434609413147, 0.4061119854450226, 0.7025602459907532, 0.35959959030151367, 0.713251531124115, 0.3207077383995056, 0.4485638737678528, 0.447488933801651, 0.3169417381286621, 0.8091883659362793, 0.4566538631916046, 0.9181888103485107, 0.43169912695884705, 0.5341503620147705, 0.9312196969985962, 0.5562829375267029, 0.7060582041740417, 0.7137264013290405, 0.8424592614173889, 0.37177184224128723, 0.5487756133079529, 0.2636317312717438, 0.896018385887146, 0.7632690668106079, 0.5343506336212158, 0.44837716221809387, 0.4811290204524994, 0.5718922019004822, 0.3522874712944031, 0.2971824109554291, 0.4178555905818939, 0.47138118743896484, 0.2575656771659851, 0.9058043360710144, 0.46757975220680237, 0.6215907335281372, 0.7873858213424683, 0.5159049034118652, 0.7154905200004578, 0.7336032390594482, 0.6238906383514404, 0.4432927668094635, 0.638227641582489, 0.4182758927345276, 0.9285688400268555, 0.6450140476226807, 0.44225257635116577, 0.7073991298675537, 0.835994303226471, 0.6727256178855896, 0.7233463525772095, 0.7793979048728943, 0.9081862568855286, 0.33412474393844604, 0.6672292351722717, 0.761063814163208, 0.3419412076473236, 0.3306105136871338, 0.7956486940383911, 0.362125426530838, 0.9532498717308044, 0.2504825294017792, 0.6381295919418335, 0.9094533920288086, 0.889875054359436, 0.8030186891555786, 0.2671167552471161, 0.3734407126903534, 0.9414187073707581, 0.2507098615169525, 0.7009753584861755, 0.4821629226207733, 0.5816243886947632, 0.801579475402832, 0.42417478561401367, 0.9059349298477173, 0.675926685333252, 0.8480045199394226, 0.8433707356452942, 0.9059651494026184, 0.6342374682426453, 0.446822851896286, 0.871786892414093, 0.8420974016189575, 0.36664313077926636, 0.30959534645080566, 0.6526715159416199, 0.7962037324905396, 0.7972975969314575, 0.5313887000083923, 0.6226022839546204, 0.844813883304596, 0.7077690362930298, 0.49140626192092896, 0.7641669511795044, 0.7865058779716492, 0.3292750418186188, 0.29709622263908386, 0.39491239190101624, 0.5608326196670532, 0.4428320825099945, 0.4734521508216858, 0.794347882270813, 0.5867761373519897, 0.8019121289253235, 0.4974234402179718, 0.7886846661567688, 0.5207729935646057, 0.26942968368530273, 0.2693708837032318, 0.31585708260536194, 0.3593807816505432, 0.41037026047706604, 0.4665238559246063, 0.7003092169761658, 0.3967599868774414, 0.4912812113761902, 0.46476176381111145, 0.584555447101593, 0.34456849098205566, 0.2558909058570862, 0.2555162012577057, 0.2646126449108124, 0.2970077097415924, 0.3390815854072571, 0.45537805557250977, 0.47989413142204285, 0.2801710367202759, 0.3857239782810211, 0.44370928406715393, 0.44215771555900574, 0.2851361632347107, 0.2523547112941742, 0.25287148356437683, 0.2566007971763611, 0.28066131472587585, 0.31532004475593567, 0.4423389434814453, 0.3844348192214966, 0.2593420445919037, 0.34186452627182007, 0.42751944065093994, 0.3940240740776062, 0.2677018344402313, 0.25109991431236267, 0.2519736588001251, 0.2537165880203247, 0.2689564824104309, 0.2986558675765991]]"," all, the filing is a long and detailed document and the toll road’s future is clearly in the hands of the state’s highway commission, which is still negotiating with the federal government over a final plan for the EZ Pass system.
The highway commission has proposed that the federal government allow the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to implement its own commuter toll system, which would be more efficient than the current system. The commission has also proposed a tolling system that would charge tolls as opposed to a regular cash system – which would mean that the state’s current cash toll system would be phased out in favor of an electronic system.
But the state’s highway commission is also negotiating with the feds over other components, and the final plan for the EZ Pass system is likely to include some elements that the federal government does not like and may include a host discount for those living in Chelsea.
Meanwhile, all sides are expected to continue negotiating with the federal government over","- and out of the City of Boston is set to receive the new toll rates effective Jan 1, 2015 by way notice from DASS and through electronic notices to state departments which are responsible to notify them and the City of Boston of this action by January 16 at midnight on New Years Day 2015 unless it is necessary either to extend this action to a longer due by January 16 at midnight on New Years Day 2015 due to unanticipated or unavoidable adverse effects of such action; to modify this action for public benefit or the improvement of a quality of life; to discontinue a particular rate due; to discontinUE a special rate; to modify for payment by check; by check made out to the department; by electronic transfer; by check made out to the department; by electronic transfer; by check made out to the department; by electronic transfer; by check made out to the department; by electronic transfer; by check made out to the department; by electronic transfer; by check made out to the department;",200,200,0.14819336771965028,0.3244748294353485,"{'num_tokens_scored': 134, 'num_green_tokens': 129, 'green_fraction': 0.9626865671641791, 'z_score': 19.05242831965579, 'p_value': 3.1361968097437233e-81, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

7860,"Chattanooga Railway. In a city famous for its ``choo choos,'' the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is billed as the world's steepest. Back in the 1880s, a group of Chattanooga businessmen built an elaborate hotel just below a famous point on Lookout Mountain. To convey guests to the hotel, they built a narrow-guage railway up the side of the mountain. Today the hotel is long gone, but the railway remains, and it gives passengers the chance to see one of Tennessee's most impressive views.

Nearly 2,000 Americans were turned away at French borders this year for not having visas. To enter France, you must get a visa - a stamp in your passport showing it has been examined by the proper officals of that country - before you go. You'll need a valid passport, $15, one passport-sized photo of yourself, and an application form completed and signed. Visas are issued on the spot if you apply in person; by mail it takes up to three weeks. A visa is valid for three years and permits you to stay up to 90 days at a time. For application and instructions, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the French Consulate in your region or to the French Embassy, 4101 Reservoir Rd. N.W., Washington, DC 20007.
Memorize your passport number. You'll need it when you cash a traveler's check, fill out a customs form, or register at a hotel.
Take a sweater. Even if you're traveling in a tropical hot spot, an air-conditioned bus or restaurant may be uncomfortably chilly.
Don't automatically change your dollars to local currency. Many cities will take those dollars, and it saves constant switching back and forth to new money.
Take an umbrella. Hopefully it won't rain. If you're touring by bus, rack it there.
Use a camera that offers control over flash. You'll get more pictures. Often it's the flash, not the picture taking, that's objectionable.
Coordinate your watch with your guide's. If you don't, and your watch is slow, you may get left behind.

3185,"The third season of Sons of Anarchy saw the motorcycle gang travel to Ireland and back, and ended with many of them going to prison. But while Jax (Charlie Hunnam) and Clay (Ron Perlman) patch up their relationship in jail, Tara finds out that Jax's deceased father and former leader of the motorcycle club feared that he would be killed by Clay and Gemma. We asked SOA creator Kurt Sutter about where he wants to take the fourth season, and when viewers can expect the crap to hit the fan.
TV Guide Magazine: What was the feedback you got for the third season?
Sutter: It's been primarily good. It's always a risk when you take your guys out of their main environment and I think when we went to Ireland people started wondering what that was about, but I think once we started to reveal the mythology about why we were going to Ireland and the weight of that on Jax. I saw that one of the sites was picking their favorite season and oddly enough Season 3 was up by three or four percent over season 2. So overall I think there was something fascinating about the scope of it, and going out of their environment. I love revealing the mythology, I love the whole IRA connection and the thematic weight of that. I'm a history guy, so there's a part of me that was digging on that.
TV Guide Magazine: Where do you see the fourth season going? Do you see more focus being placed on what happened to John?
Sutter: I think that always looms out there for Jax and I think the information he got this season will continue to impact him. But I think Season 4 will really be about dealing with the ramifications of all that new information, and it's a different Charming that they're coming back to. It's a different gun business for them. The 21st Century really starts to creep into the town and into the club.
TV Guide Magazine: What does that mean, specifically?
Sutter: I think ultimately there's a lot more progress in the town with Hale now becoming mayor there'll be a lot more development in the town. All the things they've been trying to avoid for years will ultimately start to creep in. If they can't keep Charming contained anymore, how do they deal with that?
TV Guide Magazine: Are you tempted to make it more about Clay and Jax and Gemma?
Sutter: I think ultimately, it is about the three of them and everything sort of is either background or devices to complicate all those relationships. I think Clay has a personal connection with Charming and there's something about the karmic weight of if he can keep that"," town small and safe, everything else we do is OK. So I think it's important for Clay to maintain that relationship with Charming. So it will be interesting to see how he deals with that this season.
TV Guide Magazine: I assume there will be another confrontation between Clay and Jax at some point.
Sutter: At some point. I think it's interesting that we opened those wounds up in Season 2 and then let them heal over in Season 3. I think one of the most powerful moments of the season for people was in the finale when Clay says to jax, 'I love you, son.' In contrast to what was going on last season, and I think there's almost a greater sense of betrayal when those wounds heal over and you ultimately rip the scab off again.

7934,"NEWARK – Filling out his Winnipeg Jets lineup card has probably never been tougher for head coach Paul Maurice than it is right now.
That job only figures to become more challenging later this month with the expected return of defenceman Jacob Trouba and centre Adam Lowry from injury.
As the Jets get face to face the New York Rangers on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, Maurice isn’t planning to make any lineup changes after his team has posted consecutive victories to improve to 39-17-9 on the season.
Jets forward Brandon Tanev missed 10 consecutive games with an upper-body injury, but is expected to be a healthy scratch for the second contest in a row.
Just how does Maurice strike the balance between not wanting to change things up and finding room for a player that was an effective player for the Jets prior to the injury?
“That is a really good question and I’m working on that,” Maurice said after the Jets skated at the New Jersey Devils practice rink on Monday afternoon. “Fairly soon, if everything plays out, we’re going to have four extra healthy forwards that have all played for us.
Starting with training camp, the competition to both stay in the lineup and earn more ice time began in earnest.
But as injuries and opportunities occurred over the course of the season, youngsters like Kyle Connor and later Jack Roslovic have not just established themselves as regulars – they’re making an important contribution on the top two lines.
Connor is actually third on the Jets in goals (22) and sixth in points (41), which is even more impressive when you consider he started in the AHL and missed the first six games.
The addition of veteran centre Paul Stastny gave the Jets even more strength down the middle.
And after starting the campaign with what was basically a top-six and bottom-six forward group, the Jets have evolved into a team that features three scoring lines and a checking line, albeit one that can also chip in offensively.
Having that type of depth is a luxury the Jets haven’t really enjoyed during the six previous seasons.
It makes them a dangerous group to contend with and opposition coaches are being forced to make tough choices when it comes to which line to play the top defence pairing against.
Do you load up and try to contain Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler or do you send the shutdown group out against Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers?
And don’t forget about veterans like Little and Mathieu Perreault.
It essentially becomes a bit of a pick your poison situation.
Internal competition can be a driving force and bring out the best in players.
It can also make life difficult for those on the outside looking in – especially for guys who had been carving out a role like Tanev, as a penalty killer who uses his speed to create havoc on the forecheck.
The goal for every team is to win,"," but those clubs who are often the most successful find a way to make the necessary personal sacrifices while working hard enough to be ready whenever their number is called.
Winning often makes being a healthy scratch a bit more palatable, even though it’s never easy to accept.
“If you’re out of the lineup, obviously you want to be and be playing and be a part of it but for a team, it’s a good thing to have,” said Little. “The depth is so deep that you have good players out of your lineup and good players that are fighting for ice time and trying to get in. We can someone up and they’re NHL ready right off the bat and we’ve got guys fighting for spots in the lineup. We still have guys on the (Manitoba) Moose right now that aren’t even here that can probably step in pretty soon and be a player on this team.",814,614,200,26.92817974090576,62.361549377441406,"[[0.6247575879096985, 0.6364511847496033, 0.38712432980537415, 0.6089990735054016, 0.6795368790626526, 0.5514982342720032, 0.8136716485023499, 0.846771240234375, 0.8924971222877502, 0.9004815220832825, 0.4522019028663635, 0.547035813331604, 0.7490946650505066, 0.30292975902557373, 0.47772711515426636, 0.8637328743934631, 0.49593621492385864, 0.7428766489028931, 0.25870659947395325, 0.902125358581543, 0.2525641620159149, 0.8322457075119019, 0.6959231495857239, 0.9345214366912842, 0.7767956852912903, 0.7838369607925415, 0.5214982628822327, 0.4387868642807007, 0.7226877808570862, 0.7318344116210938, 0.9172590374946594, 0.7278103828430176, 0.5791706442832947, 0.4089612662792206, 0.6064485311508179, 0.5427951216697693, 0.7376470565795898, 0.7477889657020569, 0.9028529524803162, 0.3517903983592987, 0.6969732642173767, 0.7339083552360535, 0.5080275535583496, 0.7634775638580322, 0.8722912073135376, 0.9275388717651367, 0.2790846526622772, 0.5165784358978271, 0.8819814324378967, 0.6150469183921814, 0.33605730533599854, 0.9104964733123779, 0.9505719542503357, 0.6141219139099121, 0.2520958483219147, 0.9293206930160522, 0.8435308337211609, 0.6180804371833801, 0.6315751075744629, 0.2515782415866852, 0.8192675709724426, 0.2571180462837219, 0.4714488387107849, 0.9167575836181641, 0.6923089623451233, 0.9272492527961731, 0.264937162399292, 0.5216743350028992, 0.6201798915863037, 0.5138354897499084, 0.6141343116760254, 0.26068049669265747, 0.2509898841381073, 0.8529478907585144, 0.5840068459510803, 0.7012894153594971, 0.2841602861881256, 0.7199965715408325, 0.8267039656639099, 0.7133783102035522, 0.4470616281032562, 0.2582475244998932, 0.7059061527252197, 0.8466984033584595, 0.8866792917251587, 0.968412458896637, 0.8555293083190918, 0.7648443579673767, 0.7591606974601746, 0.7439376711845398, 0.7720405459403992, 0.8204751014709473, 0.4465269446372986, 0.4222184419631958, 0.9065435528755188, 0.7067856788635254, 0.7547941207885742, 0.6625221967697144, 0.6512090563774109, 0.5310399532318115, 0.7308593988418579, 0.6905288100242615, 0.9373596906661987, 0.7300064563751221, 0.8935865759849548, 0.663240373134613, 0.7938427925109863, 0.6643399596214294, 0.63597571849823, 0.9148221611976624, 0.41273805499076843, 0.5637781023979187, 0.4053913950920105, 0.5777991414070129, 0.3037630617618561, 0.4409549832344055, 0.2817208468914032, 0.30819591879844666, 0.6787809133529663, 0.25584354996681213, 0.798321008682251, 0.9353834390640259, 0.883105456829071, 0.6962845325469971, 0.5580430030822754, 0.9208338260650635, 0.6556503772735596, 0.836784839630127, 0.2579015791416168, 0.8616443276405334, 0.9589323997497559, 0.40948933362960815, 0.548255205154419, 0.7574177980422974, 0.7217353582382202, 0.8436148762702942, 0.8361442685127258, 0.8774935603141785, 0.8871989250183105, 0.7121018171310425, 0.6481145024299622, 0.8011887073516846, 0.760803759098053, 0.43390995264053345, 0.9020345211029053, 0.9579160213470459, 0.7867264151573181, 0.8156347870826721, 0.7126122713088989, 0.7183876633644104, 0.931171178817749, 0.8718326091766357, 0.8191365003585815, 0.7196896076202393, 0.8457919359207153, 0.8001713752746582, 0.8506859540939331, 0.7930296063423157, 0.8917494416236877, 0.7599269151687622, 0.8990920782089233, 0.773937463760376, 0.8022693395614624, 0.6615203619003296, 0.6115817427635193, 0.8906500935554504, 0.4538634419441223, 0.6040704250335693, 0.3699491024017334, 0.7530423998832703, 0.7534788846969604, 0.737892746925354, 0.8405553698539734, 0.3789854049682617, 0.639974057674408, 0.3670109510421753, 0.7650594115257263, 0.827302873134613, 0.6962302327156067, 0.325947642326355, 0.2839528024196625, 0.33413684368133545, 0.6792454719543457, 0.7556887269020081, 0.8599892854690552, 0.8679692149162292, 0.4844163656234741, 0.8531144857406616, 0.2621072828769684, 0.867757260799408, 0.5779731869697571, 0.2962867021560669, 0.9287317991256714, 0.8443336486816406, 0.8877969980239868, 0.6431325674057007, 0.8809387683868408, 0.9092169404029846, 0.7771031260490417, 0.8387266397476196]]"," but there should be some level of fairness to how that is achieved.
The Jets have been able to lean on their depth this season and they’re looking to build on that by adding some more lines and options.
“If we can get everyone healthy, it’s going to be great for us,” Maurice said. “We’ll just keep working and let the chips fall where they may.”
The Jets were definitely the better team in the first period against the Rangers on Saturday, but that doesn’t mean it was always going to be that way.
The Jets have certainly been better when coming back from deficits.
It’s not so much that the Rangers are the better team, but they have already proven they are capable of producing when they’re up against it.
The Jets have been able to respond to two-goal deficits in the past, but that was before the addition of Blake Wheeler and"," at all and every, and Maurice has been impressed by the team-building abilities of general Mike Yeosham to get some young coreberry together to compete at a big international tournament before they hit full tilt on what is a four‑year rebuilding cycle and the transition away of longtime core members such a Blake Wheeler (who is set to play in next week´s world championship) to a younger nucleus. The roster has been tweaked for each tournament, so to speak to get in sync with each guy so his game is on a more consistent and realistic footing by next season at minimum. It´s a tough business when your future is on UNCLASSIFIED I don¬t think it is a question to me when it is a choice on what is a better player to move to a line and how to get them into game, how to get them into games and how to get them into situations,"" Maurice noted of how he is thinking of dealing forward. ”You are thinking of every circumstance and how",200,200,0.1346408987045288,0.311807746887207,"{'num_tokens_scored': 191, 'num_green_tokens': 184, 'green_fraction': 0.9633507853403142, 'z_score': 22.767701626367447, 'p_value': 4.792085184867145e-115, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

9583,"The Bears already made one major move to strengthen the offensive line when they signed left tackle Jermon Bushrod. This will create competition at right tackle, as Gabe Carimi and J'Marcus Webb will each push to earn the starting job. But the Bears still need to think about guards, and that's one area they can address with the draft.
Chance Warmack from Alabama is one of the best options for the Bears out of the draft. As a 6-foot-2, 317-lb. guard, he could fill holes in the Bears' interior line. He is known as a"," powerful run blocker, which would make Matt Forte quite happy.
The National Football Post says he has a nasty edge to his game, which the Bears line has been lacking since Olin Kreutz left the team. Part of keeping the quarterback safe means punishing the defenders who dare lay a hand on him. Warmack has the game to make it happen.
And it's not a bad idea for the Bears to bring in young, fresh talent on the interior. Lance Louis is a free agent who is coming off an ACL tear, and he still may not return. Roberto Garza just turned 34, and Chris Spencer and James Brown aren't as reliable the Bears need them to be.
Plus, that name! Think of all the headlines we can come up with the name Chance Warmack. It's a great, great football name that would fit well on the back of a Bears jersey. If he's available when the Bears pick at 20, Warmack would make sense for Chicago.",321,121,200,22.04783344268799,57.259666204452515,"[[0.914665162563324, 0.6208148002624512, 0.6122124195098877, 0.8306112289428711, 0.25462207198143005, 0.8877424597740173, 0.8482456207275391, 0.42148494720458984, 0.7724442481994629, 0.49617546796798706, 0.5570180416107178, 0.5160539150238037, 0.8399267196655273, 0.847188413143158, 0.8232017755508423, 0.8369734883308411, 0.5768021941184998, 0.7293624877929688, 0.2663037180900574, 0.3127261698246002, 0.4458478093147278, 0.2808156907558441, 0.6346197128295898, 0.8155290484428406, 0.32228171825408936, 0.8397600650787354, 0.5448952913284302, 0.7904897332191467, 0.7140864133834839, 0.599068820476532, 0.6325181126594543, 0.8630804419517517, 0.7576712965965271, 0.5870124697685242, 0.7573583126068115, 0.459675133228302, 0.30610936880111694, 0.2889481484889984, 0.7311211228370667, 0.7522586584091187, 0.3181139826774597, 0.7987916469573975, 0.4659445285797119, 0.4306982159614563, 0.6820468306541443, 0.7013887166976929, 0.3069542646408081, 0.8525769114494324, 0.25452056527137756, 0.8247607946395874, 0.9004648923873901, 0.6924141645431519, 0.5937250852584839, 0.4868357479572296, 0.45192474126815796, 0.5967471599578857, 0.4427558481693268, 0.5416646003723145, 0.5635047554969788, 0.8744980096817017, 0.6555669903755188, 0.2500784993171692, 0.7732574343681335, 0.8576492071151733, 0.6963493227958679, 0.6779577136039734, 0.5556554794311523, 0.7612780928611755, 0.7666006088256836, 0.25515010952949524, 0.5141373872756958, 0.5267091393470764, 0.6821609735488892, 0.38998302817344666, 0.7245360612869263, 0.7570927739143372, 0.8698630928993225, 0.4643072783946991, 0.706559419631958, 0.5233426094055176, 0.5700340867042542, 0.8989916443824768, 0.8989356160163879, 0.283322274684906, 0.5612280964851379, 0.5296200513839722, 0.5410234332084656, 0.2873949110507965, 0.37162894010543823, 0.6328977942466736, 0.653796374797821, 0.8919621706008911, 0.25064852833747864, 0.5247074365615845, 0.46344971656799316, 0.47973158955574036, 0.32537493109703064, 0.8908348083496094, 0.7374690771102905, 0.744522213935852, 0.47136953473091125, 0.5293070673942566, 0.8572717905044556, 0.8899433016777039, 0.966071367263794, 0.3660411238670349, 0.8591837286949158, 0.7840792536735535, 0.7992321848869324, 0.7759515643119812, 0.851901650428772, 0.25700831413269043, 0.5951767563819885, 0.7033635377883911, 0.9003275036811829, 0.8607625365257263, 0.49852868914604187, 0.9189621210098267, 0.714398205280304, 0.2500975728034973, 0.761772096157074, 0.7279094457626343, 0.687908947467804, 0.6891218423843384, 0.79539555311203, 0.8018925189971924, 0.4226815104484558, 0.6558057069778442, 0.25015777349472046, 0.8270774483680725, 0.7705333232879639, 0.7767590284347534, 0.7542996406555176, 0.2631857693195343, 0.30596300959587097, 0.2521517872810364, 0.7321612238883972, 0.2824304401874542, 0.4053909480571747, 0.5259302258491516, 0.8596142530441284, 0.8554701209068298, 0.9209927320480347, 0.9371019601821899, 0.44002220034599304, 0.4592593312263489, 0.32808881998062134, 0.8716685175895691, 0.4159910976886749, 0.6956377625465393, 0.7448087334632874, 0.8323747515678406, 0.8285017609596252, 0.7497649192810059, 0.5292319059371948, 0.8386271595954895, 0.5945360064506531, 0.7598717212677002, 0.786767840385437, 0.49638310074806213, 0.8237512707710266, 0.8344321250915527, 0.7178160548210144, 0.5957146883010864, 0.8438809514045715, 0.7617006897926331, 0.5378665924072266, 0.890166699886322, 0.7050938606262207, 0.6523048281669617, 0.6839714050292969, 0.6238758563995361, 0.6941330432891846, 0.5130327343940735, 0.34318822622299194, 0.6588830947875977, 0.5693910717964172, 0.7059456706047058, 0.7719042897224426, 0.6998766660690308, 0.6796932816505432, 0.38607120513916016, 0.5151505470275879, 0.9040970206260681, 0.2579739987850189, 0.8115085959434509, 0.8401481509208679, 0.7322238087654114, 0.41020873188972473, 0.3736569881439209, 0.5237027406692505, 0.4073812961578369, 0.7253989577293396, 0.5537843704223633, 0.4187214970588684, 0.25506335496902466, 0.8242194056510925, 0.914057731628418, 0.8296802639961243, 0.5273712277412415]]"," run blocker and a good pass protector, with the ability to shoot gaps.
There are several reasons the Bears should consider drafting Warmack in the first round. The Bears have been looking for a guard to upgrade their offensive line, and Warmack provides that. He is also a versatile prospect, which is a need for any team.
Warmack would be the Bears first guard selected since Billy Turner in the fifth round of the 2005 draft.
Warmack is also the first guard selected by the Bears since Chucky Scott in the first round of the 1983 draft.
The Bears have also been looking for a guard for long stretches of time. They have not selected a guard in the first round since 1985.
When Warmack was drafted, the trade market for guards was not as hot as it is now. He signed a four-year deal with the Redskins for $8.25 million. The Bears could sign Warmack for a similar amount to the deal he got with the"," strong hitter who doesn't get pushed around in run blocks and is a tough player to bring to turf out from the pocket, so that could benefit him against big linebackers when run-stops are needed on third-numbers packages, such the the two-minute drill against New Orleans.
But Warmack has size concerns on an already undersized offense at left, having played left tackle in college and been relegated to that at left offensive lineman during the Senior bowl practices last weekend to get some game action, and a lot of film watched by a lot more scouts is not enough to evaluate Warmack in an organization-specific way. Warmak just turned 23-year-old earlier last weekend and is a potential candidate as long a left-handed player is taken from a left-handed offensive tackles is considered. He would have to come from Oregon if a left-handed player is taken at 29 by Chicago; Warmak was a left-handed offensive tackles for the Crimson, and could come out",200,200,0.11023916721343995,0.2862983310222626,"{'num_tokens_scored': 189, 'num_green_tokens': 187, 'green_fraction': 0.9894179894179894, 'z_score': 23.475793379128667, 'p_value': 3.6046664747963904e-122, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

It’s been a busy six months for Municipal Affairs Minister Chuck Porter, who took over the helm of the department in early July 2018.
“Municipal Affairs is a busy spot. There is a lot going on,” he told the Valley Harvester in early January. Porter’s portfolio includes the Office of the Fire Marshal, as well as the Emergency Management Office (EMO).
“Being minister for the entire province and not just one area can take a bit to get your head around when you’re passionate about the issues happening at home in your own constituency, but the key is to treat everyone the same. There is a variety of challenges among the municipalities, but also a lot of similar challenges and they’re all trying to operate on their tax base,” he said.
Porter said he encourages collaboration among municipalities so they can get the most bang for their bucks, but is trying not to put too much pressure on them after facilitating the special legislation consolidating Windsor and West Hants. So far, no other unit has requested consolidation legislation, but Porter isn’t ruling anything out.
Some councillors across the region had expressed concerns over the other legislation Porter brought to the Nova Scotia legislature in the fall: Bill 58, which requires municipalities to share their planning with neighbouring units. That doesn’t equal needing their permission, said Porter.
While he’s not in a position to share what legislation is coming forward in the house of assembly’s spring session, Porter said priorities the department has include revamping the Municipal Government Act and looking at changes to the Capped Assessment Program (CAP), which establishes a ceiling on what the amounts residential property assessments can increase annually. “There’s been a lot of talk about the unfairness of it, so maybe there is a better formula,” said Porter.
Challenges have a greater chance of creating more opportunities, but going into a new year there are still some lingering, costly problems, such as the inter-municipal service agreement that created Valley Waste Resource Management. “I can’t really comment on it because it’s still before the courts, but I’m staying on the positive side that it will all work out,” said Porter.
Just before Christmas last year, Valley Waste Resource Management was cleared by the RCMP following a complaint from the County of Annapolis at the end of July.
“Valley Waste was never advised as to the nature of the complaint,” said communications manager Andrew Garrett in"," a statement. But Valley Waste Resource Management continues to be in a precarious financial position with more than $800,000 plus interest it says it is owed by the County of Annapolis for services between April 1 and Aug. 17, 2018. Valley Waste Resource Management still has control of its transfer station on Elliot Road, while the county appeals a decision from the judicial review concerning its expropriation that was handed down in late November.
County of Kings Mayor Peter Muttart said in an email the cost of the “break-up” has yet to be determined and arbitration the province offered to pay for is not an option if the other party does not agree to it. “The alternative to binding arbitration is expensive court procedures,” he said, adding that the appeal may not be heard until the spring.
In the meantime, remaining municipal partners will be reviewing the Valley Waste Resource Management 2019-2020 budget for cost savings to cover a 17 per cent increase to them.",744,544,200,26.272810697555542,61.63380765914917,"[[0.535020649433136, 0.3881318271160126, 0.6117483973503113, 0.7744877338409424, 0.2747119963169098, 0.9718049764633179, 0.525549054145813, 0.596429705619812, 0.5568642616271973, 0.521367073059082, 0.6653667688369751, 0.5473617911338806, 0.7931752800941467, 0.7186599373817444, 0.7920310497283936, 0.40800559520721436, 0.6356112957000732, 0.8812414407730103, 0.5262786746025085, 0.7008792757987976, 0.4286189377307892, 0.7661828398704529, 0.8285202980041504, 0.5673239231109619, 0.8887939453125, 0.5468668341636658, 0.9307641983032227, 0.36176401376724243, 0.5176699161529541, 0.6196569800376892, 0.47534918785095215, 0.7865673303604126, 0.8043473958969116, 0.4446045458316803, 0.43205755949020386, 0.7460864186286926, 0.7406381964683533, 0.5576781034469604, 0.46511828899383545, 0.5939000844955444, 0.6400432586669922, 0.46012550592422485, 0.9157058596611023, 0.608850359916687, 0.6496506929397583, 0.4159390926361084, 0.32831308245658875, 0.5586184859275818, 0.8962250351905823, 0.7348910570144653, 0.7603731751441956, 0.8907265663146973, 0.556614875793457, 0.780882716178894, 0.4933100640773773, 0.5730292201042175, 0.49325087666511536, 0.6409818530082703, 0.36594122648239136, 0.6022242903709412, 0.6534643769264221, 0.3573780655860901, 0.4075605571269989, 0.28272679448127747, 0.31072115898132324, 0.47469955682754517, 0.28652384877204895, 0.3147806227207184, 0.34480562806129456, 0.26191580295562744, 0.2623574435710907, 0.25173354148864746, 0.2754923105239868, 0.27338024973869324, 0.25555717945098877, 0.26714199781417847, 0.37353408336639404, 0.2533361315727234, 0.25230106711387634, 0.25381675362586975, 0.25513947010040283, 0.255399614572525, 0.2679731845855713, 0.25525400042533875, 0.34299299120903015, 0.2529200315475464, 0.2573947608470917, 0.25502246618270874, 0.2527421712875366, 0.2524213194847107, 0.25169867277145386, 0.2510744631290436, 0.38787519931793213, 0.2545921504497528, 0.26002609729766846, 0.3553095757961273, 0.25561821460723877, 0.2543134391307831, 0.2509547472000122, 0.25925663113594055, 0.2521141767501831, 0.25300267338752747, 0.26173993945121765, 0.3872571587562561, 0.25406545400619507, 0.25225022435188293, 0.2524467706680298, 0.25200098752975464, 0.2537265419960022, 0.2554299533367157, 0.25235995650291443, 0.30886736512184143, 0.25141823291778564, 0.2524213492870331, 0.25160545110702515, 0.25110194087028503, 0.25076982378959656, 0.2507690489292145, 0.25034475326538086, 0.29783013463020325, 0.252010315656662, 0.25475946068763733, 0.27110618352890015, 0.2523590922355652, 0.2504569888114929, 0.2509600818157196, 0.25248339772224426, 0.2513740658760071, 0.25210118293762207, 0.25941386818885803, 0.3811798095703125, 0.25228217244148254, 0.25197938084602356, 0.25091180205345154, 0.25048407912254333, 0.2513180673122406, 0.2528943419456482, 0.2513990104198456, 0.290490061044693, 0.2508651912212372, 0.25125542283058167, 0.2509838044643402, 0.2505600154399872, 0.2505028247833252, 0.250667542219162, 0.2502748370170593, 0.27038171887397766, 0.2511170506477356, 0.2535611391067505, 0.25646722316741943, 0.2513439953327179, 0.25020238757133484, 0.2509344220161438, 0.2509066164493561, 0.2510652244091034, 0.25147247314453125, 0.2595481872558594, 0.360399454832077, 0.25145068764686584, 0.2516343891620636, 0.25047916173934937, 0.2502864897251129, 0.25054940581321716, 0.2517693340778351, 0.25111687183380127, 0.2753669321537018, 0.2506190836429596, 0.25054317712783813, 0.2506309449672699, 0.2503412067890167, 0.2503346800804138, 0.25066685676574707, 0.2502608597278595, 0.25686049461364746, 0.25073879957199097, 0.2523801028728485, 0.2521043121814728, 0.2508755028247833, 0.2501373887062073, 0.8583418130874634, 0.8256385326385498, 0.5055965781211853, 0.5523759126663208, 0.6735612154006958, 0.8240889310836792, 0.7567582726478577, 0.27230891585350037, 0.7763354182243347, 0.7442196607589722, 0.5280460715293884, 0.7080609202384949, 0.8672465085983276, 0.76171875, 0.8198201656341553, 0.8989755511283875, 0.6546033620834351, 0.41176918148994446, 0.706965446472168, 0.4714553654193878, 0.7958280444145203]]"," an email late December.

Porter is an avid cyclist, but his most recent cycling exploits were a little bit different.
Porter was cycling through the Annapolis Valley, and on the way was an ambulance.
“I stopped and a helicopter flew over me and my bike,” he said. “I was going about 25 kilometres an hour. I didn’t even know it was a helicopter until I looked over and I saw a cop car and a helicopter.”
The helicopter crew, called the Chesley Fire Department, showed up, got Porter out of his bike and covered it with a tarp.
“They were extremely kind,” said Porter. “They took me to the hospital, and I was given a ride home by the fire department.”

5556,"FOUR of Diamonds have defended Honey G after they lost out on their place on the X Factor last night – while the controversial rapper was saved.
The girl group insisted Honey – real name Anna Guildford – “deserved” her place in the music contest as she works so hard.
The band - made up of Caroline, Lauren, Yasmin and Sophia - have also jumped to the defence of mentor Louis Walsh, insisting they couldn’t wish for a more “caring” judge.
And asked about Honey G being kept in the competition, despite furious backlash from viewers, they told us: “We all love Honey G, she’s great and she works so hard. She deserves her place as much as anyone else in the competition now.
And it’s not just Honey they’re full of praise for, as despite claims there had been tension with mentor Louis, all four girls couldn’t gush about him more.
“Louis doesn’t get enough credit as a mentor, he is so lovely to work with and he’s so caring,” Lauren told us.
“We spend so much time with him, we have his number, we used to call and text him all the time… He really cares, and I don’t think many people see that side of him.
The girl group got off to a rocky start on the live shows, as they were brought in to replace Brooks Way at the last minute, as the"," duo quit amid assault allegations.
Four of Diamonds broke down in tears ahead of the performance on Saturday over negative comments they had received online, after they were saved over singer Gifty Louise.
The Sun exclusively revealed previously that the band had been formed in a workshop, after all four girls auditioned as solo artists.
And explaining exactly how it happened, Caroline revealed: “We had our producers audition, and interviewed as solo artists, then management company got involved which was separate from the show got in touch, and they put us together at a workshop, before we met the judges as a group.
While Ryan Lawrie and Emily Middlemas are more loved up than ever, Lauren admitted there’s no other romances in the house.
The girls also appeared on Lorraine today, and Yasmin said: ""We are so happy to have got this far.

4410,"Churchville-Chili swimmers Tyler Regelsberger and Brandon Crist set sights on making an impact at states.
Churchville-Chili seniors Brandon Crist and Tyler Regelsberger are Section V’s dynamic duo, the Batman and Robin of Section V boys swimming.
Who’s who is up for debate.
They both wear goggles like Robin's mask, but have builds like Batman. “The Boy Wonder” would serve as a fitting nickname for either.
Regelsberger disagrees with Crist, showcasing a less diplomatic version of The Caped Crusader.
One thing is certain, the 2017 Democrat and Chronicle All-Greater Rochester boys swimming selections have put together “super” performances this season.
The dynamic duo, who are also second cousins, have a combined nine top-four times across seven individual events and are members of a pair of Saints’ top-six relay times.
Regelsberger has recorded a top-three or better performance in five individual events this season. His 100-yard freestyle (48.31) performance is second-best in Section V, while his 200 freestyle (1:46.51), 200 individual medley (2:00.82), 50 freestyle (22.08) and 100 breast stroke (1:01.87) times are No. 3.
For the 100 butterfly (54.65) and 500 freestyle (4:52.12), his performances are good for No. 9 and No. 6, respectively.
His 50, 100, 200 and 500 freestyle times are state-meet qualifiers.
Not to be outdone, Crist has four top-four individual performances, including a Section V-best performance in the 500 freestyle (4:34.79). He has the No. 2 time in the 200 freestyle (1:44.33) and the No. 4 time in the 100 freestyle (49.09) and 100 butterfly (53.72).
His 100 backstroke (57.02) is ninth-best in Section V, while his 50 freestyle (22.64) is top-10 and 200 individual medley (2:07.53) is good for No. 13.
His 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle and 100 butterfly times are good enough to qualify for states.
The pair also regularly participate in the Saints’ 200 and 400 freestyle relays, with the fifth-best sectional time in the 400 (3:28.06) and sixth-best time in the 200 freestyle (1:35.07).
As for whether Batman would better serve as a lead or anchor, Regelsberger sees himself as a “lead-the-charge” version of the Bat.
Crist’s Dark Knight is more of a “save-the-day” type.
Except for Crist’s 500 freestyle, there are more than a number of second-bests and third-bests. Enter Pittsford",", whose program and individual dominance in the pool provides Churchville-Chili’s Dynamic Duo with their own personal Legion of Doom to battle against. Name an individual event or relay, and odds are a Panther tops the list.
Pittsford sits atop the latest Democrat and Chronicle’s large-schools swimming poll, whereas the Saints were left off, despite the efforts of Regelsberger and Crist. This isn’t the result the pair envisioned at the start of their final high school season, but are doing everything they can to unify their team and help it succeed.
As team leaders, much of the responsibility falls on the Saints’ standout seniors.
It will take a super-human effort to get Churchville-Chili back into the Class A team sectionals picture, but Regelsberger and Crist have the talent to pull it off.

2547,"A teenage health crisis led Surbhi Sarna to found a company aimed at detecting ovarian cancer early. Today Boston Scientific is purchasing the startup firm for up to $275 million.
A quest to detect ovarian cancer for other women led Sarna, 32, to found a company, nVision Medical of San Bruno, Calif., to raise $17 million in venture capital, and to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration to develop a specialized device for detecting ovarian cancer. (The device is not yet for sale.) Now Boston Scientific, the Marlborough, Mass.-based medical device giant, says it will buy nVision for $150 million upfront and another $125 million to be paid if certain clinical and commercial milestones are hit over the next four years. Sarna, who was on Forbes' 30 Under 30 In Healthcare list in 2014, plans to remain with the company.
""I did not start this company because I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I was looking for some concept,"" says Sarna. ""I did not start this company because I wanted to be a CEO or I wanted to be in charge. Those were all necessary things that I needed to do to get this product to where it needed to go. Now, this is the best place for me to be in order to keep seeing that happen.""
The market opportunity for the device could be from $500 million to $2 billion annually, says David Pierce, an executive vice president at Boston Scientific and president of the company's MedSurg division. Some 300,000 women have their ovaries removed each year, he says, mostly because they either have suspicious masses on them or because they carry a version of the BRCA gene that makes them very likely to develop cancer. The nVision device aims to give doctors a way to watch for cancer in these patients. ""We're really excited about this acquisition,"" Pierce says. ""The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is a massive unmet need in this space."" The deal could be accretive to Boston Scientific's earnings as soon as 2020.
Sarna is the daughter of Indian immigrants. Her mother, a Ph.D. in Hindi literature, stayed home to raise her children. Her father, an engineer, worked at a series of startups. She founded nVision straight out of college in 2009, continuing to work day jobs in the medical device industry. She had few connections, and often met with deaf ears. ""I've been in several boardrooms with all male VCs who are like, 'Oh. This is a women's issue,"" she says.
After a year and a half, she managed to raise $250,000. Her biggest backer was Darshana Zaveri, a woman who was a partner at Catalyst Health Ventures. Sarna hired an engineer named David Snow, who had been her boss at her last medical device job. Together they faced a huge engineering challenge. They needed to collect cells from the Fallopian tubes, which lead from the ovaries to the uterus. But these tubes, Sarna says, are a millimeter wide, between four and 12 centimeters long, and have, in he words, ""the consistency of wet paper towel."" Trying to push a catheter through them would risk damaging that delicate tissue.
Their solution? A balloon, which would follow the path up the Fallopian tube as it inflated, and would collect the cells on its surface. nVision conducted an initial 40-woman study to see if it could get the balloon into the Fallopian tube, and a second 40-woman study to prove that it could enter the full length of the tube and collect cells. A third study of woman who were having their ovaries removed compared the results of looking at the cells with the pathology reports on the ovaries to see if it could detect cancer. The results have not been published, but Sarna and Pierce both say that the test had high sensitivity and specificity. Contractually, the outside doctors who conducted the research have the right to be the first to release the results.
As nVision's product moved forward, investors became more interested. Astia Angels, an angel investing group, backed her, as did Michigan's Arboretum Ventures, which led a $12 million series B. She remembers first sitting down with a team from Boston Scientific at a medical meeting in Las Vegas several years ago. It was the end of the day, and they were all tired, but she remember the team's excitement. ""You know when someone just really gets something and understands it right away?"" she says. ""It was awesome.""
Last summer potential acquirers started expressing interest in the company. Sarna says she was in no hurry. Half her series B had not been spent, and Arboretum had set aside cash for another investment round. Boston Scientific was one potential buyer. But the meetings went so well that, at one point in negotiations, Sarna told a Boston Scientific executive: ""Hey. My team really likes your team."" She says she was thrilled that Boston is the company acquiring nVision. Thursday, two members of the Boston Scientific team flew across the country to take her to dinner at Octavia, an award-winning San Francisco Restaurant, where they ate steak and deviled eggs and talked for six hours. Her husband, an"," entrepreneur whose startup recently raised $60 million, was baffled that anyone could talk about work for so long.
The challenge will be convincing women and their doctors that it really is safe to watch for cancer using nVision's test. Boston Scientific plans a larger, 120-patient study. But Sarna says that women are already in a position of waiting and watching, and choosing to balance the health costs of removing their ovaries and going into early menopause and sacrificing some of their childbearing years with the risk of cancer. She says she wants to give them a better option than existing diagnostics, which she scoffs are no better than flipping a coin.

The acquisition is the latest in a string of deals for Boston Scientific's MedSurg division. Last year it announced a $1.5 billion deal to acquire Xyrem, a painkiller used to treat patients with opioid withdrawal, and earlier this year it bought the company that makes the Logic device, a drug-delivery system that helps treat serious heart conditions.
Boston Scientific is hoping to get nVision to market by the end of 2019.", entrepreneur and venture capitalist from New Orleans is on a mission of his of helping women get diagnosed with cancer so she has a voice when treatment is offered to her at a more expensive treatment centers near San Rafael by a different kind technology called radiofrequency ablation. This treatment uses RF energy to shrink a tumoral mass. The Abbvie-sponsored treatment centers are more widely adopted because they are more efficient—the radiofrequency is more precise on each woman and doesn't have to travel long distances between treatments to get to each woman since RF energy is more precise on each woman who is undergoing treatment simultaneously by means not available to remote centers such as nVision that is more compact on the treatment table because patients are more mobile. But abvies have to travel long distances between treatment locations to get to each woman since RF energy is more precise on each woman who is undergoing treatment simultaneously by means not available to remote centers such nVoyageous as radiofrequency abvies to get to each woman,200,200,0.1585435700416565,0.3341983819007874,"{'num_tokens_scored': 165, 'num_green_tokens': 160, 'green_fraction': 0.9696969696969697, 'z_score': 21.349662311336, 'p_value': 1.963831734590348e-101, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

8970,"Viacom Inc.'s chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, is expected to tell investors and analysts at an industry conference in California today that his company will put most of Simon & Schuster, its $2 billion publishing operation, up for sale, people involved in the sale said yesterday.
Simon & Schuster's educational publishing businesses will most likely be put on the block. But Viacom is expected to hold onto the Simon & Schuster trade imprint, which has published such recent best sellers as ''Diana: Her True Story -- In Her Own Words,'' by Andrew Morton; ''The Christmas Box,'' by Richard Paul Evans, and ''Wait Till Next Year,'' by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company is said to have been hired to handle the sale, which analysts say could fetch $4 billion to $4.5 billion.
A Viacom spokesman declined to comment.
A Simon & Schuster sale has long been expected. Ever since Viacom acquired Paramount Communications in 1994, Mr. Redstone has shown little interest in the publishing operations.
When Paramount was independent, the book business assured steady earnings to stabilize the more volatile movie and television operations. But after the merger, Viacom's cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, offered the same type of stability and more opportunities for entertainment programming and marketing. The profit margins for the cable network business are also far higher.
The educational publishing division does, however, own some fast-growing operations, including Computer Curriculum Publishing, which provides computer programs for schools, and the Educational Management Group, which delivers live interactive custom curriculums to two million students in 4,000 schools.
It is not clear yet whether the Simon & Schuster businesses would be sold in pieces or as a whole.
Educational publishers like McGraw-Hill and Harcourt Brace might be interested in acquiring the kindergarden-through-high school publishing business or the college textbook operation; other companies may want just Computer Curriculum.
Bantam Doubleday Dell, owned by Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant, has been widely speculated to be interested in buying into Simon & Schuster. Stuart Applebaum, a Bantam Doubleday spokesman, however, said yesterday that the company was not interested in the educational division but only in trade publishing, a unit not expected to be up for sale.
A top executive at Simon & Schuster said that all the decisions were being made out of Viacom and that they knew little about the parent company's plans. Meetings are scheduled today for the division's top executives with Simon & Schuster's chief executive, Jonathan Newcomb.
According to people involved with the sale, Viacom has not yet begun circulating the detailed financial data that buyers require to analyze a prospective acquisition. Still, Viacom is said to hope a deal will be completed by the second or third quarter of 1998.
In the 1996 fiscal year, Simon & Schuster accounted for $2.3 billion of the company's $12.1 billion in revenue and for $217 million of the $1.2 billion in operating income.
In contrast, the company's cable networks and broadcasting business generated roughly the same revenue, $2.4 billion, but $630 million in operating income -- or nearly three times that of the publishing business. Since 1994, the book business's profits have jumped only 12.7 percent, while the network and broadcasting business has seen a 95 percent surge in profits.
Viacom had considered spinning off some of its publishing assets, but in order to do a spinoff without generating large taxes, the company would have to to hold onto the assets for at least"," five years. That would have forced it to keep Simon & Schuster until 1999, clearly too long for Mr. Redstone.
''They're biting the bullet,'' said John Tinker an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ''But the real question now is how much they actually get and how fast they can actually pay off'' Viacom's $8 billion debt, he said.
The consumer book division, the Simon & Schuster operation that Viacom is said to be keeping, is a business that generally makes little money and operates at low margins. Still, the business offers Viacom the chance to cross-market books and films.
Not every media company, however, has been interested in such potential synergies. The Seagram Company, for example, which acquired both the publisher Putnam Berkley Group and Universal Studios when it acquired MCA, decided in 1996 to sell the publisher to Pearson P.L.C.'s Penguin Group for $336 million.",967,767,200,28.142080783843994,64.42964911460876,"[[0.7336447834968567, 0.26450568437576294, 0.4923514127731323, 0.5014793276786804, 0.5651285648345947, 0.9339178204536438, 0.9349359273910522, 0.29492756724357605, 0.6931031346321106, 0.45938754081726074, 0.5735263824462891, 0.9196310043334961, 0.8188750743865967, 0.332959920167923, 0.6814998388290405, 0.5411058068275452, 0.6308405995368958, 0.7946374416351318, 0.7997314929962158, 0.3770045042037964, 0.5914710760116577, 0.6093684434890747, 0.5549761056900024, 0.8454814553260803, 0.37810519337654114, 0.6272017955780029, 0.5274673104286194, 0.6419055461883545, 0.3842819333076477, 0.3579105734825134, 0.26151251792907715, 0.2727687954902649, 0.26803839206695557, 0.4922983646392822, 0.6013556718826294, 0.2608640193939209, 0.37834498286247253, 0.2766737639904022, 0.2766657769680023, 0.26748186349868774, 0.27381545305252075, 0.25190791487693787, 0.25443920493125916, 0.25895968079566956, 0.4233333170413971, 0.36663466691970825, 0.25397545099258423, 0.30123597383499146, 0.2603375315666199, 0.25828781723976135, 0.25483256578445435, 0.261454701423645, 0.25129997730255127, 0.25278162956237793, 0.2634073793888092, 0.3563787043094635, 0.30656495690345764, 0.2523593306541443, 0.26858022809028625, 0.255130797624588, 0.25366201996803284, 0.25197479128837585, 0.2576737105846405, 0.25085514783859253, 0.2515070140361786, 0.2630707919597626, 0.31304338574409485, 0.275763601064682, 0.25179043412208557, 0.26040178537368774, 0.2527272403240204, 0.2519790828227997, 0.25093919038772583, 0.2546185255050659, 0.2506074607372284, 0.25098785758018494, 0.2612295150756836, 0.28535327315330505, 0.2648528516292572, 0.2511741518974304, 0.2555581033229828, 0.25158530473709106, 0.2511524260044098, 0.2505006194114685, 0.2527744770050049, 0.25044432282447815, 0.25072020292282104, 0.25899431109428406, 0.2684718072414398, 0.25983181595802307, 0.25082650780677795, 0.2532989978790283, 0.251026451587677, 0.25076013803482056, 0.25034409761428833, 0.25198355317115784, 0.25038495659828186, 0.2505793571472168, 0.25692054629325867, 0.2613498866558075, 0.2579176127910614, 0.25065526366233826, 0.2525347173213959, 0.2508808672428131, 0.250609427690506, 0.2502833604812622, 0.25165146589279175, 0.25036343932151794, 0.25060808658599854, 0.2552106976509094, 0.2578094005584717, 0.25624117255210876, 0.2505418658256531, 0.25189486145973206, 0.2506805658340454, 0.2505902945995331, 0.2502427101135254, 0.2516491115093231, 0.25036779046058655, 0.25060924887657166, 0.25431618094444275, 0.256280779838562, 0.25479358434677124, 0.25045570731163025, 0.2515937387943268, 0.2505542039871216, 0.2506427466869354, 0.25024381279945374, 0.2516005039215088, 0.250373512506485, 0.2505571246147156, 0.25381335616111755, 0.25558650493621826, 0.25405240058898926, 0.25041452050209045, 0.2513863444328308, 0.2505052387714386, 0.25071707367897034, 0.25029125809669495, 0.25156664848327637, 0.2504054605960846, 0.2505947947502136, 0.2538393437862396, 0.25689178705215454, 0.2534835636615753, 0.2503942847251892, 0.25118985772132874, 0.25041767954826355, 0.2505090534687042, 0.2503369450569153, 0.25145652890205383, 0.25045350193977356, 0.250604510307312, 0.255194753408432, 0.2582370936870575, 0.25312867760658264, 0.2504503130912781, 0.25112470984458923, 0.25039809942245483, 0.2503509521484375, 0.25031936168670654, 0.25133243203163147, 0.25047019124031067, 0.25064489245414734, 0.25542858242988586, 0.2593259811401367, 0.2527853846549988, 0.2504701614379883, 0.2509579062461853, 0.25034400820732117, 0.2502802610397339, 0.2502128779888153, 0.2511027753353119, 0.2504180073738098, 0.2506064474582672, 0.2545502483844757, 0.2574189305305481, 0.2525073289871216, 0.2505178451538086, 0.25084108114242554, 0.2503194212913513, 0.25020962953567505, 0.25015732645988464, 0.25087273120880127, 0.25038236379623413, 0.2505209743976593, 0.2543885409832001, 0.2552797794342041, 0.25316011905670166, 0.250534325838089, 0.2508145570755005, 0.25031113624572754, 0.25018516182899475, 0.25012728571891785, 0.250816285610199, 0.25037363171577454, 0.2504578232765198, 0.2546163499355316, 0.25457459688186646, 0.25413405895233154]]"," five years.
The publishing company's headquarters are in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., just across the Hudson River from Manhattan. It employs about 1,200 people, most of whom work in the company's New York headquarters.
Mr. Redstone, who is also chairman of Paramount, has been a strong advocate of keeping the publishing company separate from the rest of Viacom. In 1996, he refused to let the company spin off its magazine unit when he could have avoided paying a higher dividend to shareholders.
Last year, executives at Paramount and Viacom discussed selling the publishing company, but Viacom said it would do nothing until it was offered a good price.
Viacom has held several meetings with potential buyers, including Justice Leighton Vance, the chairman of the New Jersey Supreme Court who is a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.

8636,"Zuke Chutoro, seared Bluefin tuna cured in Soy sauce at Kusakabe in San Francisco, Calif., is seen on Saturday, July 19th, 2014.
Sitting in Kusakabe at the light polished wood sushi counter, cut from a single tree, with a delicate glass pitcher of sake, a small hand towel in a black saucer and the fifth of 11 courses, the thought emerges: This style of refined dining could also be a boon for fixed-price Western restaurants.
The people who say they wouldn't go to the French Laundry, Benu or Saison because of the precious parade of courses, the formal atmosphere and the extended length of time at the table are some of the same people sitting at the sushi counter eating one bite of delicate sushi after another, as one hour slips into the next.
It's hard not to be captivated by the skill of chef-owner Mitsunori Kusakabe. There are no decisions to be made as diners sit back, relax and are taken on a culinary journey that costs $95 for 11 dishes, mostly sushi but with a soup course and another hot dish.
Dinner begins with a briny broth of kelp tea designed to decompress the 17 patrons at the sushi bar and the 12 who are seated at tables. The waiter also brings a damp black finger towel so diners can wipe their fingers after picking up the sushi with their hands - the way suggested by the waiter, who is as calming as the tea.
Kusakabe defines his menu as omakase sushi, kaiseki style, referring to two distinct types of dining. Kaiseki is a set menu, precisely designed and served. A true omakase menu is based on individual diners' preferences gleaned from their ongoing relationship with the chef. It's a menu built on trust.
Yet in a broader sense the term is accurate here because the chef creates the menu; it's somewhat standardized, but on each of my three visits he made adjustments. Every ingredient is sliced, chopped, drizzled and squeezed to order.
For the first course, the chef places a piece of bluefin tuna, dark from its soy sauce cure, on a small pad of rice. He briefly torches half the flesh to caramelize it, intensify the flavor and firm up the texture - an artful contrast in a single bite.
Next comes a piece of halibut sliced to order, with shallow slits in the flesh to help diffuse the flavorings. The chef adds a dab of its liver gently scooped from a tiny tin, places it on the center of the white flesh, dribbles on a soy-like sauce and tops it with delicate ribbons of shiso. Next up is bonito with a small mound of pickled daikon and rings of scallions.
The sashimi - slices of amber jack and halibut because I am allergic to the scallops that would normally be part of the mix - is arranged on a mound of what looks like snow cone ice accompanied by a soy dipping sauce and a chunky blend of yuzu and onions.
Miso soup offered a warm change of pace, an intense broth with two tender duck meatballs, mitsuba (Japanese parsley) and a hint of sansho peppers. On other visits the soup featured summer truffles floating among the ribbons of herbs, with eringi and shimeji mushrooms visible just below the surface. The flavors are at once strong and subtle.
Next comes what's labeled unique sushi, although everything that came before could be described the same way. In this case, ""unique"" meant Tasmanian trout cured in kombu on two squares of rice flavored with cilantro and sesame seed. It was finished with sesame miso to bring all the flavors together.
On subsequent visits, the chef served a rice flour cracker that resembled a small pottery bowl shaped like a flower. It's so shiny and well formed that the chef had to tell me to pick it up and eat the entire thing, because I had started to use chopsticks to pick up the rice and barbecued eel on top.
Next is the second warm dish, which was the same on all three visits - two finger-size pieces of crab on tofu, caked in crispy rice and garnished with a slice of key lime so thin it looked like parchment. The waiter then pours on Hokkaido kombu dashi broth. It's yet another example of the tension between bold, subtle, crisp, creamy, warm and cool - the dish touches all those notes. This type of juxtaposition describes many of Kusakabe's dishes.
The next two bites, labeled ""sushi chic,"" included striped bass with a sprinkling of sea salt, gratings of Meyer lemon peel and a few drops of juice. In between each course the chef wipes off the black lacquer rectangles on the shelf above the counter in front of each diner, and replenishes the small bowls of pickled ginger.
For her part, the server is always subtly looking over diners' shoulders, answering questions and helping them to decide what to order from 16 sakes, 16 wines or five beers.
The sake is available in a 3-ounce glass, 6-ounce carafe or by the bottle. Each round is served in different containers - crystal cubes, thick earthen pottery, translucent green cups and long-stemmed wineglasses for the more expensive Daiginjo ($15-$30 for a 3-ounce pour).
The meal continues to progress from lighter to heavier preparations. Next is what turns out to be the most intriguing dish of all - Copper River salmon with just a sprig of microgreens on top. I could have sworn there was a brush of maple syrup because it was so sweet, but we were simply tasting the natural essence of the fish. In just about every case, the fish is served at the perfect stage for sushi.
To finish, there's a choice: a slice of A5 Wagyu or toro - a lush, fatty piece of fish - on a pad of rice and topped with a small knob of wasabi.
That's the end of the tasting menu. From there, diners can order from 20 a la carte sushi or sashimi items or, if you have an appetite like mine, you might want to try the expertly prepared Santa Barbara sea urchin ($8.50 per piece), Hokkaido uni ($14) or barbecued white eel ($14). Then there's whiting cured with kombu and bonito"," flakes ($8.50), cherrywood-smoked bonito ($8.50) and five maki rolls, including one with braised Japanese squash ($7.50).
Desserts are also extra: mild green tea creme brulee ($6) and a refreshing yuzu and shiso ice ($4.50) topped with a green tea cookie in the shape of a K.
By the time you get to that point you feel as satisfied and refreshed as if you've had a relaxing massage and rest.
On my last visit, as I was paying the bill, the gracious waiter leaned over and whispered that if I let them know next time, they would do preparations differently from the printed menu. Finally I discovered what a true omakase menu might mean.

You can also order the sushi house's three-course set menu, which costs $95 per person. On my most recent visit, a group of four of us ordered the omakase set, one of the top diners, plus a bottle of sake and two bottles of wine. We each had one of Kusakabe's special dishes.
This kind of dining, which is a throwback to the classic days of the kaiten (sushi bar) in Japan, can be a viable business model for Western chefs. After all, Kusakabe's restaurant is in one of the most desirable places drawings people from all over the world.
Given Kusakabe's success, he has opened a second restaurant, Miho, in San Francisco's Nob Hill neighborhood. Miho's menu is more traditional than Kusakabe's, with plenty of dishes that require a little more time to prepare"," served to-takeout and the fish served a la cart to a table at each course; the prices are $6 to 10 a piece for each serving unless ordered a la cart as a sushi combo; the kombu is $5.25 a piece and so is a half cup of sashiko sake to start your sushi experience - just ask. The prices are $85 (9-piece) to about 25 a la carte sushi ($18 each).

8637,"BULLISH Alex McLeish is not expecting the chop when he meets Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner next week.
McLeish’s first season in charge has seen him narrowly avoid ­relegation and furious fans have called for his head.
With a record low four wins at home this season, McLeish has had to endure torrents of abuse from disgruntled supporters.
But he revealed that he will go into talks with"," the board outlining the kind of budget he thinks he needs to start turning the club around.
Big Eck said he hadn’t given any consideration to question marks over his future.
He said: “I haven’t ­given that any thought at all. Hopefully now we can move forward.
“I’ve been in charge one season. Did anyone expect me to win the league? Come on – I think people have to be more understanding.
“I anticipate being here next season. Yes, we have underachieved for a football club like Aston Villa.

5184,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - U.S. and Russian flight controllers worked to fully restore computers aboard the International Space Station on Thursday after a system crash that could force the $100 billion outpost’s crew back to Earth.
NASA said it did not regard the problem as critical and believed it was a long way from having to contemplate abandoning the space station, a 16-nation project.
But the U.S. space agency made plans to keep the visiting space shuttle Atlantis attached to the station for an extra day to help steer the massive complex if the Russian computers, which control navigation, continue to malfunction.
“We’re still struggling to understand what the real problem is here,” said NASA’s associate administrator for spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier.
Flight directors told the crew to cut power to noncritical equipment, like lighting, to conserve electricity and fuel in case the shuttle’s mission to the space station is extended.
In the worst-case scenario, the three astronauts aboard the station, including NASA’s newly arrived Clayton Anderson, could leave in the escape ship, a Russian Soyuz capsule.
As a precaution, the Soyuz was put on battery power on Wednesday for seven hours before one primary and one auxiliary computer system in the Russian modules were rebooted on Thursday, allowing the capsule to be returned to station power.
Two other primary systems, which control navigation and operate life support systems like an oxygen generator and air purifiers, remained shut down.
The station has backup systems for life support and the shuttle has been firing its control jets to help it maintain proper orbit.
“We won’t ask you how you’re doing because we can imagine,” a Russian flight director, speaking through a translator, said to station commander Fyodor Yurckikhin, who skipped a night’s sleep to work on the computer problems.
The computer glitches began shortly after a newly installed solar wing panel began producing power. Gerstenmaier said it would likely take days to find out why the computers were misbehaving.
Work continued on Thursday on the retraction of the second half of an older solar wing panel that must be moved before the new array can rotate and track the sun for full power.
Spacewalking astronauts Patrick Forrester and Steven Swanson helped guide the old wing into its storage"," box on Wednesday. Their crewmates James Reilly and John “Danny” Olivas are due to finish the job during a spacewalk on Friday.
Reilly and Olivas also are scheduled to repair a bit of protruding insulation near the rear of the shuttle. A corner of the blanket tore loose during Atlantis’ launch six days ago, potentially exposing inner layers of the shuttle’s surface to superheated gases on re-entry.
NASA had already extended Atlantis’ mission from 11 to 13 days and added a fourth spacewalk to make sure there was enough time to fix the blanket and retract the old solar wing.
The astronauts must also prepare other station systems for the arrival of new laboratory units and life support equipment for an expanded, six-person resident crew.

The power problem will likely have a significant negative consequence to future space travel by the InternationalSpaceStation because computer-related failures have been blamed for the loss of control by a crew member of the outpost two years ago and have threatened to endanger future space expeditions. The cause remains a puzzle because of how long a computer issue could linger without its original manufacturer discovering a",146,200,0.13162154694126077,0.309453866481781,"{'num_tokens_scored': 195, 'num_green_tokens': 192, 'green_fraction': 0.9846153846153847, 'z_score': 23.690634306538815, 'p_value': 2.2516930505531076e-124, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

Napier shearer Ricci Stevens completed a unique double of doubles on Saturday night when he won a New Zealand Senior shearing title final, which would almost inevitably have its own special place in shearing sports history whomever won.
The 26-year-old had also on Thursday won the senior woolhandling title, having also previously won the junior titles in both aspects of the shearing sports – shearing in 2015 and woolhandling last year.
No other competitor has won New Zealand championships titles in both shearing and woolhandling.
The runner-up was King Country-based Catherine Mullooly, who as a junior on the same stage in 2014 became the first woman to be named top-ranked competitor in any grade of shearing and who last night was just 1.145pts from becoming the first female senior winner since the championships were first held as the King Country Shears in 1985.
Third place went to South Island-based Luis Pincol, from Chile, just 2.211pts from scoring the biggest-ever win by a shearer from South America.
The shape of the senior final changed dramatically when top-ranked Tegwyn Bradley, of Woodville, winner of 14 other finals during the season including the Golden Shears, was eliminated in the semifinals on Saturday afternoon.
Son-in-law of 2017 world champion and employer John Kirkpatrick, Stevens made his intentions clear",", more than 20 seconds clear of nearest challengers Mullooly and Pincol through the halfway stage and ultimately shearing the 12 sheep in 13min 58.38sec, half a minute clear of eventual second-man-off and Gore-based fourth placegetter Lionel Taumata, from Taumarunui.
Mullooly was third to finish, in 13min 31.28sec, and was by more than a point the best shearer in the board judging, but suffered in the judging in the pens afterwards.
The 2017 Intermediate champion, Masterton-based Sean Gouk, was fifth and sixth was Whakapunaki (Naki) Maraki, of Flaxmere, who on Thursday was fourth in the Junior woolhandling final won by partner Ngaira Puha.
Stevens has the choice of going up to open grade in both shearing and woolhandling next season, but is still just short of the threshold for upgrading.",526,326,200,23.931469440460205,59.80345273017883,"[[0.7472086548805237, 0.3122168183326721, 0.2650493383407593, 0.7223889827728271, 0.37059473991394043, 0.8430835008621216, 0.9414989352226257, 0.6420612931251526, 0.7292031049728394, 0.8718541860580444, 0.5335870385169983, 0.8824496269226074, 0.8702870011329651, 0.6934045553207397, 0.7545019388198853, 0.8176599144935608, 0.782937228679657, 0.3400343060493469, 0.6326046586036682, 0.3637242913246155, 0.963805615901947, 0.5894951820373535, 0.36218327283859253, 0.3748341500759125, 0.807184100151062, 0.6310049891471863, 0.7529006600379944, 0.7614194750785828, 0.9744277596473694, 0.5245988965034485, 0.8035471439361572, 0.7314504384994507, 0.6964778900146484, 0.9342690110206604, 0.8054131269454956, 0.8752284646034241, 0.7826391458511353, 0.3026973009109497, 0.7661767601966858, 0.6653741598129272, 0.7657081484794617, 0.7242368459701538, 0.6557663679122925, 0.7557967305183411, 0.7739921808242798, 0.2598753273487091, 0.8781717419624329, 0.898465633392334, 0.4841715097427368, 0.27933502197265625, 0.5761404633522034, 0.3722612261772156, 0.8987950682640076, 0.7110792398452759, 0.8952839970588684, 0.3436517119407654, 0.8798471689224243, 0.5441316962242126, 0.5371556878089905, 0.5901014804840088, 0.7751573324203491, 0.6303879618644714, 0.34572044014930725, 0.869110107421875, 0.849801242351532, 0.4011997580528259, 0.7541917562484741, 0.9424529075622559, 0.42973053455352783, 0.841017484664917, 0.9680632948875427, 0.8392127156257629, 0.6540904641151428, 0.6898804306983948, 0.46081432700157166, 0.8192512392997742, 0.6123030185699463, 0.7384381294250488, 0.9200171232223511, 0.7789165377616882, 0.7935447096824646, 0.3944755494594574, 0.7144991159439087, 0.6999603509902954, 0.32771411538124084, 0.5411821007728577, 0.5166001915931702, 0.5561645030975342, 0.380621999502182, 0.8615749478340149, 0.8329547047615051, 0.7007356882095337, 0.8362740874290466, 0.6494196653366089, 0.7951999306678772, 0.8786710500717163, 0.9644368886947632, 0.9619312286376953, 0.6788239479064941, 0.6419443488121033, 0.6723825335502625, 0.7337568998336792, 0.906255841255188, 0.8854906558990479, 0.9214950799942017, 0.8829770088195801, 0.2617873549461365, 0.8035620450973511, 0.8275001049041748, 0.6554214954376221, 0.7987527251243591, 0.47066062688827515, 0.42381805181503296, 0.6393560767173767, 0.5947997570037842, 0.4208170175552368, 0.87796950340271, 0.8323050737380981, 0.7516158819198608, 0.8768768906593323, 0.8358286619186401, 0.8660693168640137, 0.7663508057594299, 0.2647668123245239, 0.7261013984680176, 0.8843035101890564, 0.6996760964393616, 0.7835256457328796, 0.8937382102012634, 0.3889066278934479, 0.5379761457443237, 0.5000319480895996, 0.4969106614589691, 0.5004633069038391, 0.5983940362930298, 0.7510062456130981, 0.5826672911643982, 0.6029372215270996, 0.8287568092346191, 0.8351298570632935, 0.9494051337242126, 0.4631027281284332, 0.7166531085968018, 0.7149428129196167, 0.2676047682762146, 0.8995449542999268, 0.5453127026557922, 0.8742165565490723, 0.2667301893234253, 0.781221330165863, 0.92792809009552, 0.8617019057273865, 0.9427714347839355, 0.9238998293876648, 0.4970981776714325, 0.9574376344680786, 0.41584324836730957, 0.40901198983192444, 0.7563910484313965, 0.9220113754272461, 0.3839201331138611, 0.5400663018226624, 0.8512170910835266, 0.2571046054363251, 0.8636409044265747, 0.9291086196899414, 0.852042555809021, 0.8778501152992249, 0.7208548784255981, 0.5096991062164307, 0.7301069498062134, 0.8907257318496704, 0.8099889755249023, 0.7186809778213501, 0.676173210144043, 0.5814592838287354, 0.5633252859115601, 0.7511097192764282, 0.5669801235198975, 0.7167242765426636, 0.8477756977081299, 0.767968475818634, 0.8638708591461182, 0.6316456198692322, 0.613540768623352, 0.48669761419296265, 0.8146350979804993, 0.47602030634880066, 0.6587947010993958, 0.49728187918663025, 0.6090302467346191, 0.4122081696987152, 0.2985253632068634, 0.4964445233345032, 0.5783904790878296, 0.40180784463882446, 0.5315178632736206, 0.6559737920761108, 0.655989408493042, 0.6936841607093811]]"," from the start, winning the first two rounds in the heat and semi-finals.
In the final, he had to win the second half, and one last time, to win the title.
""I had to win to be able to say I've won in both woolhandling and shearing,"" Stevens said. ""I was on the other side of the fence with the win in woolhandling.""
After missing the final of the woolhandling in 2016, Stevens was back this year in the NZWSA run of the senior championships, his first major effort.
His victory on Saturday night had matched his 2016, 2015 and 2014 wins in shearing, and had also beaten the previous two years' records for the number of wins in a single edition of the senior championships.
The New Zealand Wool Industry Association describes Stevens as a ""well-rounded shearer"" – a common description of New Zealand woolhandlers.
He's a former junior world champion in she"," from day dot when leading the two hearers through the first two heats by a significant gap. The second half of that first round saw him extend those early signs by leading the second hearers through the first 10 heats by more then a half of length. Stevens won by more then half of that length again. The remaining 10 legs are separated by the last two heats of each day when Stevens won by more then a half of that length. He would eventually get to 20 minutes and then run out of daylight to beat the two hearers by just over half of that length. He would have to beat the two hearers, each by a half and three quarter of length of him. That is a lot to ask out the pair of hearers of John Paul McLean from New Plymouth on the other hand – McLean was just a fraction of Stevens' length off him. In those 10 laps Stevens would eventually beat the pair by just a half and three quarter of length of him.
