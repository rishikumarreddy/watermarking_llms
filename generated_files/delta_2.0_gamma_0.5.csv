9793,"""As it becomes more difficult to defend Obama, the probability of a charge of racism approaches.""
""It is becoming well nigh impossible to deny the racist overtones of these protests.""
What, may you ask, is the strongest argument for this astounding claim?
""Many of the virtually all-white crowd on Saturday yearned for an earlier time with less government involvement in society.""
You read that correctly: the fact that this crowd was predominantly caucasian (by Winters&apos; account), proves that it must be racist. By Winters&apos; logic, the United States Senate must be ""racist"" - it is ""virtually all-white"", after all.
""But, that earlier time [of less government involvement in society] recalls, for many of us, the memory of states’ rights being enforced through dogs and water cannons.""
3)... the anti-tax marchers want a return to racial segregation.
That is Winters&apos; argument, in three easy steps.
Liberal Catholics will go ballistic when a conservative Catholic writer makes an absurd argument, and demand that fellow conservatives disown the maverick&apos;s argument. Because, on the whole, we strive to be reasonable and agreeable people, we typically do so. We can call one of our own out of bounds without feeling we&apos;ve eroded our common arguments. We can call crazy ""crazy"" because we try to avoid it. Winters seems to be reduced to just writing crazy.
Well, in similar fashion",", I&apos;d like to see some ""liberal"" Catholic writers take Winters to the woodshed for this one. People who don&apos;t like Obama don&apos;t like him because they are racist - really?! Is anyone typically sympathetic to Winters prepared to defend this claim of his? There are many more people in America who did not attend this march who are sympathetic to the concerns of those who did attend. Are all of them equally guilty of the racism Winters ascribes?
I&apos;ll be waiting for such logical reflection on these claims Winters has injected into the debate.
But frankly, until Winters himself retracts this stupidity, I&apos;ll feel free to disregard him completely.
After all, I shouldn&apos;t give my time to someone who writes for a racist magazine like America.
I mean, just look at the complexion of that magazine&apos;s editors.",522,322,200,34.49927115440369,70.21875166893005,"[[0.7005199790000916, 0.9722627401351929, 0.9013370871543884, 0.5698650479316711, 0.5836841464042664, 0.7859642505645752, 0.5703161954879761, 0.8059802055358887, 0.7198412418365479, 0.8154879212379456, 0.5872091054916382, 0.5921483039855957, 0.8858770728111267, 0.9377313256263733, 0.8241954445838928, 0.9038320183753967, 0.6338463425636292, 0.7274879217147827, 0.9664762020111084, 0.9681386351585388, 0.9791618585586548, 0.9831944108009338, 0.9863780736923218, 0.9437195658683777, 0.9519079923629761, 0.9921436905860901, 0.6181820631027222, 0.5822040438652039, 0.8985344767570496, 0.7856162786483765, 0.96720951795578, 0.9693655371665955, 0.8613120913505554, 0.8813133835792542, 0.9642804265022278, 0.8787540197372437, 0.9846488833427429, 0.8739704489707947, 0.7300953269004822, 0.9144287705421448, 0.9044559001922607, 0.8814130425453186, 0.9070393443107605, 0.977809488773346, 0.9387273788452148, 0.6140312552452087, 0.9239563345909119, 0.9491807818412781, 0.920548677444458, 0.5736446976661682, 0.8427829146385193, 0.833019495010376, 0.7874755859375, 0.5888779759407043, 0.9804797768592834, 0.7518098950386047, 0.9730684161186218, 0.8112379908561707, 0.7920598983764648, 0.5777402520179749, 0.8651697039604187, 0.9605998992919922, 0.7155939936637878, 0.9679887890815735, 0.641527533531189, 0.808454692363739, 0.9079437851905823, 0.6959010362625122, 0.7481241822242737, 0.6918776035308838, 0.7497693300247192, 0.6331206560134888, 0.6069307327270508, 0.7367202639579773, 0.7583167552947998, 0.6558049321174622, 0.5694181323051453, 0.5882418751716614, 0.5760520696640015, 0.7028834819793701, 0.8951007723808289, 0.9373162984848022, 0.9423851370811462, 0.5751083493232727, 0.9229492545127869, 0.9870399236679077, 0.8961156010627747, 0.9497506022453308, 0.9365507364273071, 0.962820291519165, 0.9757571816444397, 0.5693425536155701, 0.8835799694061279, 0.8981230854988098, 0.8307638764381409, 0.9400981068611145, 0.966848611831665, 0.7872204184532166, 0.8567371368408203, 0.6360341310501099, 0.6304504871368408, 0.836404025554657, 0.8623967170715332, 0.7776234149932861, 0.9015591144561768, 0.9407641887664795, 0.8462014198303223, 0.572957456111908, 0.5851465463638306, 0.8572206497192383, 0.8413158655166626, 0.9109735488891602, 0.9684442281723022, 0.9888120293617249, 0.7856309413909912, 0.785504937171936, 0.6747071743011475, 0.6674307584762573, 0.5688852667808533, 0.5681676864624023, 0.6387781500816345, 0.5776095390319824, 0.5743578672409058, 0.5692195296287537, 0.6918536424636841, 0.8994143605232239, 0.6933234930038452, 0.5913722515106201, 0.5841179490089417, 0.597798228263855, 0.6250063180923462, 0.5731834173202515, 0.5755277276039124, 0.572999119758606, 0.5733129978179932, 0.5717102885246277, 0.5703393220901489, 0.5738734006881714, 0.5838900804519653, 0.5689554810523987, 0.5684313774108887, 0.5692811608314514, 0.5691843628883362, 0.6912247538566589, 0.8878313302993774, 0.6575206518173218, 0.5955626964569092, 0.5680497288703918, 0.6054911613464355, 0.5766258835792542, 0.5742912292480469, 0.5911576747894287, 0.5691479444503784, 0.5849630832672119, 0.5715691447257996, 0.5686996579170227, 0.568676233291626, 0.5684193968772888, 0.6916114091873169, 0.5737832188606262, 0.570602536201477, 0.568315327167511, 0.5679802894592285, 0.5676960945129395, 0.5682955980300903, 0.5698390603065491, 0.568004310131073, 0.5824049115180969, 0.5714234113693237, 0.570781409740448, 0.5692354440689087, 0.5685260891914368, 0.5678932666778564, 0.653540849685669, 0.5801517963409424, 0.9801444411277771, 0.9568700194358826, 0.9139978885650635, 0.6827475428581238, 0.9307726621627808, 0.9379289150238037, 0.5700024962425232, 0.5832782983779907, 0.9176343083381653, 0.9746614098548889, 0.9825817346572876, 0.9938088059425354, 0.7532266974449158, 0.6403585076332092, 0.912939727306366, 0.9845154881477356, 0.9711135625839233, 0.9398723244667053, 0.9806409478187561, 0.963101863861084, 0.9458128213882446, 0.9518475532531738, 0.916765034198761, 0.9635130763053894, 0.5865954160690308]]",", liberal Catholics will go ballistic when a conservative Catholic writer makes an absurd argument, and demand that fellow conservatives disown the maverick&apos;s argument.

3801,"With so many hoops to jump through to close transactions, falling home prices, and unrealistic sellers and buyers, today’s agents have to hustle harder than ever before. This doesn’t have to be the case. With the right systems and the right processes in place, you can work smarter rather than hustling harder.
Everyone has systems. The question is: Which systems support your business to thrive vs. which systems create a drag on your production? A system can be as simple as taking a different route to work each day to search for for-sale-by-owner homes, or as complex as doing all your business online.
The hallmarks of a strong system are that it is repeatable, it reduces time and effort, and it yields consistent results. If you’re interested in working smarter rather than hustling harder, here are five areas where you can begin to systematize your business.
If you’re like most agents, you have multiple phone numbers on your business card. It’s much easier for clients to contact you on a single phone number. One of the simplest solutions is to use Google Voice. Google Voice provides you with a single phone number that goes to every one of your phones in the order you specify.
Your clients can find you easily, no matter where you are. Google Voice also allows you to keep your cell phone and your home phone private. When you are in a situation where you cannot take a voice call, Google Voice can transcribe your message into an email or text message. Surprisingly, there is no charge for this service, and it works both in the U.S. and Canada.
An increasing number of companies and agents are electing to go paperless. Many associations already publish their various contracts in a digital format. You can download these forms to any type of computer. They may also be available in the ""cloud,"" using systems such as DocuSign. Digital signatures can be obtained either through the equivalent of a lock-and-key approach (think of your credit card number tied to a password) or with an actual digital signature. On the tablet PCs, your clients sign their documents with a light pen. On the iPad, they can sign using their finger with apps such as Zosh.
Another way to go paperless is to create a digital pre-list package. In addition to the various forms and documents required to close a transaction, you can include a sample 90-day marketing plan, a digital brochure of the seller’s property, plus a link to the single-property website that you create for your sellers. Going paperless is one of the most effective ways to save both time and gasoline costs.
Many agents struggle with the idea of starting and maintaining a blog. There’s a simple solution, and it’s right in the outbox of your email. If you’re like most agents, you haven’t cleaned your outbox recently. If this is the case, look back through your past emails. Every email where you answered a client question is a potential blog post.
A simple way to create great content for your blog is to answer client questions using your blog rather than your email. Post both the question and the answer in your blog. You can also post market updates plus upcoming neighborhood events.
If you enjoy taking photos or videos, post them on your blog or your Facebook business page. Since most blogging platforms allow you to schedule your posts at a later date, increase the effectiveness of your system by doing all of your posts at the same time each week. Plug in the time and date you want the post published and the blogging platform handles it automatically.
Your interactions on social media are another great area to systematize. For example, if you have 150 Facebook friends, take 10 minutes each day to either ""like"" or comment on something that five of your friends post. At the end of the month, you will have contacted all 150 of your friends at least once.
Another approach is to use a system such as HootSuite. When you come across an article, picture, blog post, or some other online material that you believe your friends or followers may like, you can click the ""Tweet this"" button and HootSuite automatically creates a Tweet and posts to Facebook as well.
You can send the Tweet as is or modify it. The process takes just a few seconds and allows you to provide your followers with great information with a minimal amount of effort.","
How much time do you spend entering notes you have taken at listing appointments, inspections or walkthroughs on your computer? The paid version of Evernote allows you to take notes on your smartphone, iPad or personal computer. Evernote then makes those notes available on all of your Evernote-enabled devices simultaneously.
Instead of wasting time transferring this information from a handwritten form into a digital format, Evernote eliminates having to enter data twice saving you tremendous amounts of time and effort.

1713,"The value of Saudi industrial exports reached SR162 billion by the end of 2012 compared to SR110 million in 1974, Director General of Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) Ali Al-Ayed said.
Addressing a GCC industrial event in Oman, Al-Ayed said Saudi industrial exports have achieved high growth rates averaging 20 percent per year in the period 1974-2012.
It was organized by the Omani Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) in coordination with the Riyadh-based GCC general secretariat.
The SIDF chief attributed the robust growth of the industrial exports to the availability of hydrocarbons at preferential prices in addition to the conclusion of international and regional trade agreements to this end.
Plastic and chemical products accounted for 77"," percent of the total industrial exports in that year, followed by food products at 8 percent, base metals (6 percent), and electric devices and equipment (2 percent), he told the conference.
He said the SIDF used to adopt a series of measures to boost industrial exports, including attraction of foreign investments which had an effective role in transferring experience and technical know-how.
SIDF has approved SR42.2 billion, or 38 percent of total loans, for the industrial projects, he said.
He also enumerated a series of challenges facing local industries, notably how to diversify production and export base for local industries, upgrade technical knowledge, minimize global competition on local products, and how to boost efficiency of export logistics services.

9232,"Although the case has not advanced to the point where he’s assigned it to prosecutors, Campbell said there was a good chance Cappleman, who is one of four top prosecutors in his office, could have been involved.
But Campbell said the conflict wouldn’t prevent other prosecutors at the office from prosecuting Latvala.
“There’s no conflict,” Campbell said.
Latvala, 66, was at the pinnacle of his power as Senate budget chairman until allegations of sexual harassment, first reported by Politico, surfaced in November.
The Senate initiated two investigations, including hiring retired Judge Ronald Swanson to serve as special master. On Dec. 19, Swanson found probable cause that Latvala had violated Senate misconduct rules and sexually harassed a legislative aide. Swanson also said that Latvala may have violated state corruption laws by seeking sexual intimacy with a lobbyist in exchange for legislative favors.
Investigators, led by the head of FDLE’s executive investigations team, Scott McInerney, have still not reached out to key players, including Latvala and the lobbyist, Laura McLeod, lawyers for both said Tuesday.
Around the time the harassment"," allegations surfaced, Latvala hired Chaires, a former Leon County sheriff’s deputy, according to Latvala’s attorney, Steven R. Andrews.
Chaires, who owns Warrior Security Contractors, did not turn up any listening devices, he said.
Andrews noted that the work was completed before any potential criminal charges had emerged. Chaires was paid the $645 — not even a full day’s work for a typical investigator — on Dec. 11, nine days before Latvala resigned.

The lobbyist, McLeod, is married to a lobbyist for a company that Ticknor and Fields, the law firm that represented Latvala in his campaign against the constitutional amendment and other issues, recently hired as a new lobbyist.
But McLeod, who was hired by Ticknor and Fields after the harassment allegations, has said she was not involved in the sexual harassment case against Latvala.
“I have been a lobbyist for several years and have never had any contact with Senator Latvala or any of his staff,” she said in a statement."," allegations surfaced, Cappleman said the special master was working to review how the office handled the allegations of sexual misconduct against Latvala. Cappleman said Swanson would report his findings to the Senate Ethics Committee at the same time he did for any pending ethics cases.
Cappleman said the special master’s recommendation for possible ethics charges against Latvala was still pending Tuesday. The office has been unable to reach Swanson for comment or provide him with specific examples of charges they have been considering.
Cappleman said he was surprised by the news about Swanson’s findings.
“I would have thought after we got all this information, we would have been able to share it with Swanson,” he said. “I would have thought there’d be a more formal report coming from the special master’s office.”

1387,"Premera Blue Cross Cyberattack Exposed Millions Of Customer Records : All Tech Considered The health insurance provider has revealed that a cyberattack discovered in January may have made the medical and financial information of 11 million people vulnerable to thieves.
Another big health insurance company has revealed it has been the target of a massive cyberattack.
Premera Blue Cross says hackers may have taken up to 11 million customer records. Those records include credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, even information about medical problems. This news is just coming out but Premera issued a statement saying it discovered the breach on Jan. 29. That's about the same date that Anthem, another Blue Cross company, told the FBI that it was breached.
It's possible that Anthem put the word out and, given the timelines, the attacks were related — done by the same perpetrator. At least that's an educated guess from the cybersecurity company iSight Partners.
Premera also says the attack itself started in May of last year. But iSight found a suspicious domain called ""prennera.com,"" an address that may have been made to spoof Premera's official website. It was created in December 2013.
Either way, that's many, many months to steal people's data. NPR has reported previously on the black market for credit cards and health records. Will a bunch of for-sale signs go up there? Probably not this time — or at least that's according to sources who hang out in the underground.
Health care data can be more valuable than credit card information on the black market. But so far, sources say, the Anthem data hasn't shown up on the underground sites. And Premera may not either. It could be that the hackers are not run-of-the-mill criminals, but in it for cyber-espionage.
Yes, cyber-espionage. As in spies. It's possible that a nation-state actor is involved.
Both health care companies are huge providers with lots of government workers. So if someone wants intel on Defense Department employees — where they live, spouses' names, serious (or embarrassing) medical conditions, a breach is a way to stockpile that data and use it for blackmail later.
As iSight malware analyst Brian Bartholomew says: ""The sole purpose of espionage is to steal information, gain advantage. By publicizing, you're giving up the leverage you have.""
NPR has asked Premera and the FBI whether they are alerting other health care providers to watch out or providing details other companies might benefit from. Neither has immediately responded to our inquiry.
There's another group called the National Healthcare ISAC (Information-sharing"," and Analysis Center) that helps to share breach information. They say they've been in contact with private investigators at Mandiant as well as federal investigators handling the case. So far, the specific ways that Premera was attacked — like the IP addresses the attacks came from or the specific types of malware — have not been declassified and shared with other potential targets.
Director Deborah Kobza says in an email, ""It is only through coordinated sector and cross-sector cybersecurity information sharing, that we, as a nation, can move critical infrastructure cybersecurity protection from a reactive to proactive stance.""
But what is Premera doing to protect victims — the up to 11 million people who may be affected here? Premera says it is offering two years of free credit monitoring. It's the same kind of protection that retailers and financial institutions have given victims of credit card hacking. But if the point of this theft is altogether different, espionage, then identity monitoring doesn't really help in the end.",753,553,200,27.534417629241943,74.91141200065613,"[[0.8112465739250183, 0.6984253525733948, 0.9257587790489197, 0.7765972018241882, 0.7527636885643005, 0.6506472229957581, 0.940804660320282, 0.7407557964324951, 0.7971785068511963, 0.9451324939727783, 0.9657387733459473, 0.9308325052261353, 0.5780361294746399, 0.9392980933189392, 0.7871966361999512, 0.9480312466621399, 0.9011844396591187, 0.9712182879447937, 0.835685670375824, 0.5792459845542908, 0.9683771729469299, 0.9156175851821899, 0.6414943337440491, 0.7983192801475525, 0.9662107825279236, 0.9461159110069275, 0.8888030052185059, 0.8690019249916077, 0.7840269207954407, 0.9201210141181946, 0.9017744064331055, 0.9073902368545532, 0.8235176205635071, 0.9727053642272949, 0.8955342769622803, 0.9534520506858826, 0.9888264536857605, 0.8967211246490479, 0.7604081034660339, 0.9891553521156311, 0.5838578343391418, 0.7567620873451233, 0.8667831420898438, 0.9727088212966919, 0.9145782589912415, 0.9370831251144409, 0.9797521233558655, 0.5827648639678955, 0.9746906757354736, 0.9633358716964722, 0.7894514799118042, 0.7483611106872559, 0.804340660572052, 0.6844846606254578, 0.6746397018432617, 0.9552863836288452, 0.8686022162437439, 0.9643535017967224, 0.9562637209892273, 0.9239947199821472, 0.6283370852470398, 0.7791998386383057, 0.9686009883880615, 0.5681512355804443, 0.5689017176628113, 0.7036380171775818, 0.6323148012161255, 0.9139142036437988, 0.5682312846183777, 0.9436215162277222, 0.9943809509277344, 0.7217000722885132, 0.7219938039779663, 0.9745376706123352, 0.6729469299316406, 0.6577821969985962, 0.8463100790977478, 0.9473353028297424, 0.9717733860015869, 0.8664089441299438, 0.9438968300819397, 0.8389408588409424, 0.9161074161529541, 0.8907449245452881, 0.8159498572349548, 0.9405735731124878, 0.9791068434715271, 0.9580838084220886, 0.7523254156112671, 0.9322085380554199, 0.9217200875282288, 0.8524390459060669, 0.84893399477005, 0.9069429636001587, 0.5695014595985413, 0.7189024090766907, 0.7041221857070923, 0.9664798974990845, 0.9717756509780884, 0.568648636341095, 0.6973007321357727, 0.9364455938339233, 0.8726509809494019, 0.8558011054992676, 0.9203471541404724, 0.869188666343689, 0.9377979040145874, 0.7454503774642944, 0.9381732940673828, 0.9307668209075928, 0.8094663619995117, 0.9015552997589111, 0.5680002570152283, 0.5711432695388794, 0.7432066202163696, 0.945854127407074, 0.8411048054695129, 0.9660985469818115, 0.9901117086410522, 0.9311926960945129, 0.8082838654518127, 0.8970412611961365, 0.9224674105644226, 0.9707114100456238, 0.5969457626342773, 0.9561132788658142, 0.9319576025009155, 0.8845203518867493, 0.907252848148346, 0.5704997777938843, 0.7940508723258972, 0.899093508720398, 0.9163764715194702, 0.98964524269104, 0.9342864155769348, 0.941649854183197, 0.8094842433929443, 0.9753851294517517, 0.8527904152870178, 0.9104204177856445, 0.9507918357849121, 0.9648870229721069, 0.8952786326408386, 0.9626520872116089, 0.5692363381385803, 0.897645115852356, 0.8470758199691772, 0.9238761067390442, 0.9104198813438416, 0.820648193359375, 0.9200376272201538, 0.9047260880470276, 0.9529415965080261, 0.9087994694709778, 0.8897370100021362, 0.7186828255653381, 0.5717945098876953, 0.9158651828765869, 0.9010511636734009, 0.811231255531311, 0.8711419701576233, 0.7012631893157959, 0.908197283744812, 0.5680444240570068, 0.5715659260749817, 0.6953889727592468, 0.9214238524436951, 0.8469475507736206, 0.9123460054397583, 0.6904648542404175, 0.946942150592804, 0.861197292804718, 0.8767914772033691, 0.5701836347579956, 0.9859819412231445, 0.9291185736656189, 0.9233141541481018, 0.7375981211662292, 0.9720225930213928, 0.9218013882637024, 0.962489902973175, 0.8559995889663696, 0.8821349143981934, 0.7542405128479004, 0.8508757948875427, 0.7403953671455383, 0.7628585696220398, 0.9017041325569153, 0.844948410987854, 0.8218958973884583, 0.683788001537323, 0.9351024031639099, 0.7011024355888367, 0.9798578023910522, 0.9520521759986877, 0.6162078380584717, 0.6019342541694641, 0.8822355270385742, 0.984602689743042, 0.9871363043785095]]"," and Analysis Center) that is supposed to help companies share information with one another. But iSight says it's not clear where Anthem's information came from.
And, as iSight warns, health care companies don't have good defenses against this kind of attack. They rely on a lot of third-party vendors, and, as a result, they don't know what's on their systems.

The coalition is trying to get health providers and health insurers to collaborate to prevent more data breaches, Bartholomew says. FireEye's goal is to raise more money for its analysis of health IT security data and to encourage hospitals to share more data between each other.
But so far, the coalition has seen little evidence of this collaboration. Bartholomew says there are few private security companies that are willing to share data between each other.
The coalition had hoped to raise money from the security firm Mandiant for its latest report, but it has not been able to raise any money yet. Bartholomew says this is partly because of a lot of money is needed to conduct more analysis of health care networks.

3190,"China's central bank says fighting inflation will receive higher priority this year, raising the possibility of more rate hikes at a time when other major economies are trying to boost growth.
The announcement late Thursday follows repeated pledges by Beijing to cool inflation that jumped to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November. Communist leaders worry that sharp rises in living costs might trigger unrest.
""Stabilizing price levels will receive more prominent status,"" the People's Bank of China said in a report after an annual planning meeting. The bank said it will ""effectively manage liquidity and control financial conditions that might cause excessive price increases.""
Chinese stocks declined in early trading Friday after the announcement but the main index rebounded to positive territory by late morning.
The inflation surge highlights the contrast between China, which rebounded quickly from the global crisis and is trying to restore normal financial conditions, and the United States and struggling European economies.
Higher interest rates could further slow China's growth, possibly cutting its demand for factory machinery, industrial components, iron ore and other imports from the United States, Europe, Australia and its Asian neighbors.
China's rapid expansion slowed to"," 9.6 percent in the three months ending in September, down from 10.3 percent the previous quarter, though still the highest of any major economy. Analysts expect that to slow further this year as Beijing clamps down on credit and steers growth to a more sustainable level.
Analysts blame the price rises on the flood of bank lending that helped China ward off the global downturn. Inflation so far is limited mostly to food, but analysts say price pressures will spread unless Beijing raises interest rates further and tightens access to credit.
Inflation has been well above the government's target of 3 percent since late last year and some analysts expect it to rise further in December and January.
The central bank has raised interest rates twice in the past three months, most recently on Christmas Day. Many analysts expect more increases this year.

The annual meeting of China's rubber-stamp parliament also ended Thursday with a pledge by President Xi Jinping to raise the minimum wage by 30 percent over the next five years.
The wage increase will be accompanied by efforts to boost employment and to reduce the cost of education and health care, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
The central bank said the government will ""rectify"" the problem of ""lack of financial resources"" by carrying out ""effective measures"" to help small businesses.
Inflation is considered more dangerous for the ruling Communist Party because it can erode support for the ruling party as it tries to foster a market economy that is more closely aligned with individual spending.
The central bank said that ""higher-than-expected prices are mainly driven by price increases associated with increased food costs, the price of energy and raw materials and the depreciation of the yuan currency.""
The yuan has weakened 6"," 7.5 percent last year from 9.1 percent in 2010, the lowest level since 1995. The country has been trying to revive growth by cutting taxes and encouraging lending to smaller companies. That's helped fuel a property boom and a credit boom that has led to mounting defaults on home loans and other debts.
China's inflation surge highlights a contrast with the United States, where unemployment is near a 40-year low and inflation has been stuck in a narrow range as a result of years of easy monetary policy.
The central bank's announcement came after the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said last week that it would increase reserve requirements for commercial banks by 1.5 percentage points to 5 percent for a total of 10 percentage points.
Analysts said those moves would reduce short-term lending to companies and lower credit demand. Consumer prices rose at a slower pace than economist expected, but the PBoC expects inflation to remain around 5 percent for the next six months.

5360,"JUST a month after coming into power, the Zifa board have been rocked by a tsunami with vice-president Gift Banda being suspended yesterday following a meeting of the game's leaders held in the capital.
The Bulawayo-based football administrator, who was a runaway winner in the battle for the Zifa vice-presidency, was suspended for allegedly reshuffling the Warriors technical team without the blessing of his boss, Felton Kamambo, and other board members.
Banda, who was Zifa acting president when he announced that Rahman Gumbo and Lloyd Mutasa had been relieved of their duties and replaced by Bongani Mafu and Tonderai Ndiraya, was said to have acted beyond the jurisdiction of his authority.
In arguments presented to his fellow board members yesterday, Banda said he felt his role as the acting president empowered him to make such decisions.
He even suggested that if what he did was out of line with the constitution, then the board had the power to reverse the appointments and stick with the old Warriors technical set-up.
Kamambo was out of the country in Senegal for the Caf awards at the time.
The appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu had to be ratified at the Zifa board meeting which was held yesterday but things quickly took a nasty turn when Banda was asked to leave the room while other board members discussed the issue. While the board could have merely chosen not to ratify the appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu, if they felt they had not been done according to their constitution, they decided that punitive measures should be meted on the Zifa vice-president.
The matter was taken to a vote and four of the seven remaining members voted for Banda to be suspended, pending the confirmation of his suspension by the Zifa Council at the association's annual meeting in March, while three voted for him to be retained as the vice-president.
Ironically, Banda, who received 35 votes from Councillors in a strong showing in his successful battle to become the Zifa vice-president just a month ago, had"," his fate sealed by just four votes from his fellow board members.
Interestingly, a margin of one vote was all that mattered for him to be suspended from his post and he becomes the first Zifa vice-president to meet such a fate since Kenny Marange was also kicked out of the board by the leadership of Cuthbert Dube eight years ago.
It's the first time that a Zifa vice-president, the second most powerful man in the management of the game in the country, has been booted out after just one month.
Zifa boss Kamambo had, interestingly, told the domestic football family that his leadership will not suspend any of the board members because he felt such a system crippled the operations of the leadership of the game. However, things changed dramatically yesterday when Banda was shown the red card by his fellow board members just one month after coming into office.
Banda refused to comment on the developments yesterday saying he will release a comprehensive response in due course.",633,433,200,25.857082843780518,61.474231004714966,"[[0.9789986610412598, 0.9863775372505188, 0.8552440404891968, 0.7624749541282654, 0.9537652730941772, 0.8184736371040344, 0.5906757116317749, 0.7472701072692871, 0.8026307821273804, 0.8646712303161621, 0.9486484527587891, 0.5704041123390198, 0.9770525693893433, 0.6861472725868225, 0.7947208285331726, 0.6181529760360718, 0.9038642048835754, 0.6855112910270691, 0.732624888420105, 0.7467150092124939, 0.8716351389884949, 0.9737240672111511, 0.9085373282432556, 0.8386712074279785, 0.9637855887413025, 0.6673974394798279, 0.5760425925254822, 0.5785354971885681, 0.9306422472000122, 0.6449269652366638, 0.9371141195297241, 0.9576081037521362, 0.5758991241455078, 0.8756864070892334, 0.9602912068367004, 0.9594767689704895, 0.9421162605285645, 0.5727430582046509, 0.9512433409690857, 0.923815906047821, 0.796078085899353, 0.9277989864349365, 0.862784206867218, 0.5677737593650818, 0.5720633268356323, 0.7883871793746948, 0.8459452986717224, 0.836812436580658, 0.8055787682533264, 0.6598955392837524, 0.8203873634338379, 0.7681077718734741, 0.5684791803359985, 0.9378349184989929, 0.9512400031089783, 0.91532963514328, 0.6045276522636414, 0.9629415273666382, 0.9787479043006897, 0.6682857275009155, 0.9731795787811279, 0.591829240322113, 0.8898284435272217, 0.8765638470649719, 0.5711854100227356, 0.8782980442047119, 0.7803776860237122, 0.5891742706298828, 0.8833582997322083, 0.7497690916061401, 0.7017911672592163, 0.9585719108581543, 0.8956584930419922, 0.8957886099815369, 0.8880339860916138, 0.8698124885559082, 0.8457516431808472, 0.9506926536560059, 0.9191339612007141, 0.5697105526924133, 0.9508091807365417, 0.7548263072967529, 0.6719783544540405, 0.762724757194519, 0.9678995609283447, 0.9739071726799011, 0.5742855072021484, 0.8147150874137878, 0.9620481729507446, 0.959898054599762, 0.6196496486663818, 0.9843245148658752, 0.8776636719703674, 0.9288091659545898, 0.9215028285980225, 0.5780173540115356, 0.9262760877609253, 0.9166616201400757, 0.5869777202606201, 0.5720443725585938, 0.5707375407218933, 0.5696097016334534, 0.9589425325393677, 0.9373502731323242, 0.9702593088150024, 0.9753378629684448, 0.5773152112960815, 0.7979349493980408, 0.5730172991752625, 0.9400317668914795, 0.9745122790336609, 0.9056939482688904, 0.9641092419624329, 0.9331269264221191, 0.9312431216239929, 0.9019780158996582, 0.8485782146453857, 0.9827104806900024, 0.5692208409309387, 0.8052017092704773, 0.8595647811889648, 0.9684746265411377, 0.5788841247558594, 0.978535532951355, 0.8774245381355286, 0.7728567123413086, 0.9496785402297974, 0.9632800221443176, 0.5719678401947021, 0.8169023990631104, 0.9725545644760132, 0.9259916543960571, 0.9710196852684021, 0.9307727813720703, 0.9227399826049805, 0.8975744843482971, 0.8440592885017395, 0.7847013473510742, 0.9184789061546326, 0.8219934105873108, 0.8099334836006165, 0.7763488292694092, 0.9813747406005859, 0.9212216138839722, 0.5676965713500977, 0.8303762078285217, 0.5998640656471252, 0.5684419274330139, 0.5679718255996704, 0.5678712725639343, 0.9024466872215271, 0.9508043527603149, 0.9630000591278076, 0.8891849517822266, 0.5697005391120911, 0.8134748339653015, 0.7097519040107727, 0.963539183139801, 0.9136011600494385, 0.7488083839416504, 0.814224123954773, 0.9560528993606567, 0.5763741731643677, 0.5686104893684387, 0.568217933177948, 0.5676763653755188, 0.567905604839325, 0.5693569779396057]]"," a three-point lead over the other candidate Ndiraya, who polled 31 votes.
The suspension of Banda is the latest development in the game's power struggle which has seen the removal of acting secretary-general Kudzanai Chipanga from his position, the suspension of the technical committee members and the appointment of a new vice-president.
It also comes at a time Zifa are expected to meet the Confederation of African Football (Caf) President, Ahmad Ahmad, in Algeria this week.
Banda was last week appointed acting Zifa president, replacing Chipanga who had been suspended for allegedly mismanaging Zifa's accounts."," earlier told ZimEye.com that he was unable to attend the board meeting as he would have been busy attending the Africa Cup of Nations.
The Zifa board are now expected to meet today to consider Banda's suspension by an overwhelming majority. Banda is now set to be replaced by Mutasa while Gumbo and Mutasa have since been appointed to their respective roles as acting Zifa board members.
The Zifa board were forced to intervene when former Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa and his deputy Tendai Biti were suspended in February over financial irregularities and indiscipline involving the Zifa office.
The Zifa board and its management will meet this afternoon to decide on whether to retain Biti and Chiyangwa as the acting Zifa board and management respectively.

1180,"TLC member says she'll stream Supernova on Web site to meet self-imposed deadline.
To quote Sunshine Anderson, we've ""heard it all before.""
After years of talk and no delivery, nobody should be surprised that Arista has announced it will push back the in-store date for Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes' solo debut, Supernova, from summer to fall.
However, the self-proclaimed ""crazy"" of TLC said she'll have her music out to the people on August 16 by hook or by crook.
""I picked the 16th as the release date because something weird happened in my family,"" she explained. ""My father died and his father was born on August 16. And January 31 was the day that he was born and his father died. So they came in and out on each other's dates, and they were both 40 when they died.""
Left Eye is so adamant about the album coming out next week that she said she'll stream the album's 13 tracks on her Web site (www.eyenetics.com) starting at 12:01 a.m. on that fateful day. She's getting support from the label online; an Arista spokesperson said the tracks will also be streamed on parent company BMG's click2music.com.
""It's a very significant release date for me,"" Left Eye said. ""It was something that has been sitting in the back of my mind for a couple of years now like, 'Wow, I wonder what that means?' There's magic in those numbers for me, because 162001 equals 10, which in numerology is symbolic of a star, and the album is called Supernova. It all ties in. It's a conceptual thing but there's a deep meaning buried in it. Everything has a double meaning.""
A fair share of stars guest on the album. Look for appearances by Carl Thomas, Esthero, Blaque and Tupac Shakur.
""The track with Tupac is titled 'Untouchable,' and it speaks for itself,"" Left Eye said. ""Tupac and everything about him is untouchable to me. I didn't record the song with him. I got a copy of the song and his lyrics were on the track. If you want to talk about whether I recorded it before or after his death, I can't answer that. It's still a mystery to me.""
Left Eye said she asks about the mysteries of life, and the mysteries of Pac's life, on the track.
""I'm basically asking him to answer those questions for me,"" she said. ""In the third verse he gives me his view from the other side. Some of the song's lyrics are so heavy. He says things like, 'You remember me legendary, I live eternally.' He produced the song. It's dynamite to me because he isn't"," known as a producer. It's like a double whammy because I get a song produced by Tupac  a song featuring him that actually features me. I'm featured on a Tupac song on my album.""
As to why Arista has decided to push back the album's release after confirming it would be out on August 14 a month ago (see ""Left Eye Delivering Solo Supernova... Finally""), a label spokesperson said Arista wanted Left Eye to record more tracks for the album as well as lay vocals for the new TLC disc.

The document – published in the insider-only ‘Environmental Monitor’ – details the new All-Electronic Tolling System (AETS) implementation project, a project addressed in some measure through meetings held in Chelsea and other municipalities earlier this summer. It’s a project Gov. Deval Patrick has pushed since day one, eliminating cash toll collection booths and going to an all-electronic system. It would be the largest toll road electronic conversion project in the nation to date, if approved.
While the document made public this week is concerned mostly with environmental aspects of the project, many key details in the tolling plan emerged concerning the Tobin Bridge and harbor tunnels (Ted Williams, Callahan, Sumner and I-90 Boston Extension).
One of the major changes for the Tobin and harbor tunnels includes adding tolling locations for northbound traffic. Currently, all northbound traffic out of Boston on the Bridge and tunnels pays no toll. Under the new plan, AETS gateways would be added for northbound and southbound traffic – meaning that a person going into Boston from Chelsea or other points north would be charged going in and coming out.
There was no word in the document about whether Chelsea’s host community discount would continue for the Bridge, which would be a key question for those living in Chelsea. That said, state transportation officials have certainly had their sights set on eliminating such discounts systemwide for the last several years. That, however, will be a conversation for a different day and likely something that local leaders will have to fight for.
The toll booths on the Tobin would be demolished under the plan, and new AETS gateways would be stretched over the southbound roadway after the Bridge and just before the exit splits (Rutherford Ave. or 93 South) in Charlestown.
Later, a northbound tolling gateway is proposed to stretch across the northbound roadway just prior to the entrance to the Bridge tunnel, also in Charlestown.
The southbound Tobin AETS gateway would actually end up being the Pilot Program for the new technology – being implemented next year as a test for the systemwide change that is proposed for 2015.
The system would work via the EZ Pass electronic collection method that many already use. Statistics in the filing showed that 68 percent of tolls at the Bridge and harbor tunnels in 2012 were collected via the EZ Pass. For those who do not or cannot convert to the EZ Pass system, photos of a person’s license plate will be taken at each toll gateway and an invoice will be sent on a monthly basis to the owner of that plate. The state has already worked out a system of enforcement with other states to collect unpaid tolls from out-of-state placeholders. Similarly, those in-state placeholders who do not pay the invoices would be subject to fines and Registry withholdings.
For those in Chelsea who use the Ted Williams Tunnel or the Callahan Tunnel, there would be a major change and with no possible savings via the host discount. The northbound Callahan Tunnel and the northbound side of the Ted Williams Tunnel also will begin charging a toll – a movement that is now free as tolls are only charged for those coming into Boston.
“The Metropolitan Highway System (MHS) Williams Tunnel currently collects tolls in two nearby westbound (inbound) plazas by Logan Airport,” read the filing. “These structures will be retained, but cash collection booths and equipment will be removed. Also, this tunnel will be converted from one-way to two-way tolling, with the addition of an AETS toll zone for eastbound traffic. Rates will be modified to reflect the change in tolls by collection in both directions.
While the filing indicated modified rates for only the Williams Tunnel due to two-way tolling, it did not specify what kind of rate modification, and it mentioned no rate modifications for two-way tolling at the Tobin Bridge and Sumner/Callahan crossings.
All in"," all, 18 new gated toll locations would be added to the system to accompany the existing 24 locations.
While most of the locations are in Western and Central Massachusetts on the Mass Pike and are designed to reduce traffic congestion and the “ticket” toll system, the moves on the Boston Pike Extension and the Bridge/Harbor Tunnels would be huge changes.
Many local and state officials had no idea of the dramatic changes detailed in the filing until told by the newspaper, and all deferred comment until they could find out more information on the extensive plan.
Key members in the Legislature, however, tended to think the DOT was taking the half-a-loaf approach – asking for the full loaf in hopes of getting a half-loaf or even just a slice of bread.
Such changes can be implemented without Legislative approval – requiring only that Commissioners approve it. However, such a change would cost millions and that kind of appropriation would need to be approved by the State Legislature.",1086,886,200,44.904850006103516,59.442800998687744,"[[0.6375863552093506, 0.5860306620597839, 0.7970576286315918, 0.9613958597183228, 0.5839084982872009, 0.9470305442810059, 0.9173448085784912, 0.9571269154548645, 0.9632700681686401, 0.9384617209434509, 0.6985702514648438, 0.9243141412734985, 0.8952207565307617, 0.8861930966377258, 0.9816244840621948, 0.9271380305290222, 0.8699148893356323, 0.9593815803527832, 0.768701434135437, 0.8839449286460876, 0.7929500341415405, 0.9410957098007202, 0.9446632862091064, 0.9699118137359619, 0.8121583461761475, 0.8525108098983765, 0.925812304019928, 0.6227367520332336, 0.8186135292053223, 0.8035808205604553, 0.9374036192893982, 0.6395524144172668, 0.8820016980171204, 0.9463461637496948, 0.9358775019645691, 0.8963564038276672, 0.9688505530357361, 0.8825146555900574, 0.8825952410697937, 0.5749374628067017, 0.9147849678993225, 0.9174949526786804, 0.9469917416572571, 0.8684625625610352, 0.5965524911880493, 0.5715078711509705, 0.8557662963867188, 0.7421401739120483, 0.7621526718139648, 0.955055832862854, 0.570314347743988, 0.7562950253486633, 0.7195380926132202, 0.890702486038208, 0.6956671476364136, 0.862461268901825, 0.940161943435669, 0.7153825759887695, 0.7834857702255249, 0.8715104460716248, 0.8720797896385193, 0.570607602596283, 0.7026575207710266, 0.7023406028747559, 0.7445763349533081, 0.6091651320457458, 0.8970119953155518, 0.9610019326210022, 0.5744389891624451, 0.9009912014007568, 0.9247190356254578, 0.9318274855613708, 0.9597864151000977, 0.8802388906478882, 0.5947960615158081, 0.5779783129692078, 0.9638164639472961, 0.9639322757720947, 0.9069311618804932, 0.903304934501648, 0.7949334979057312, 0.9160243272781372, 0.8841344118118286, 0.9638882875442505, 0.9783456325531006, 0.9019086956977844, 0.9164054989814758, 0.9292963147163391, 0.7058596014976501, 0.8037359714508057, 0.765394926071167, 0.9644643068313599, 0.8287528157234192, 0.9339815974235535, 0.9481983184814453, 0.888120710849762, 0.9793370962142944, 0.7130843997001648, 0.8213883638381958, 0.8487260937690735, 0.8694441914558411, 0.9428354501724243, 0.8699989318847656, 0.8509450554847717, 0.8912014961242676, 0.850868284702301, 0.6662018299102783, 0.9100627899169922, 0.9728200435638428, 0.8322945237159729, 0.754585862159729, 0.9792755246162415, 0.9214183688163757, 0.9232628345489502, 0.8794102668762207, 0.8952194452285767, 0.9500023722648621, 0.7916330099105835, 0.9799033403396606, 0.5682540535926819, 0.7906369566917419, 0.9710478186607361, 0.7401410341262817, 0.5691514015197754, 0.7771298289299011, 0.9759781956672668, 0.7731301784515381, 0.9711644053459167, 0.828787624835968, 0.9446488618850708, 0.9496594667434692, 0.9672680497169495, 0.9079186320304871, 0.9750996232032776, 0.7835522294044495, 0.9567616581916809, 0.9117952585220337, 0.7782017588615417, 0.8023747801780701]]"," all, the filing indicated that “all tolls will be collected electronically.”
The AETS system would be installed at two of the three public tolling locations – the Ted Williams Tunnel and the Callahan Tunnel. The filing noted that the system would be ready by the end of June, and the state would begin issuing AETS permits in the fall.
“The project is still subject to the requirement that the AETS project be approved by the Secretary of Transportation,” it read. “This approval process has not yet begun. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2014.”
The filing also noted that the project would be “funded entirely by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation,” and the state would “have no direct responsibility for the project.”
“The project is funded through a combination of toll revenue, state transfer funds, and grant funding,” it read. “The Department"," all, the AETS project is a $2 billion project that would see roadways converted to electronic collection. The entire project is set to cost $2 billion and the state would pay $750 million and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority would pay $250 million for the project. The other half, $850 million, would come from a combination of existing toll road projects as well as a bond plan.
There are no details of what would happen to the toll booths or how the changes would be implemented. It appears that there will be no changes to the current system in Chelsea, Lawrence, Somerville, Waltham, Cambridge and Boston, but those areas are listed for future discussion.",200,139,0.22452425003051757,0.42764605035027153,"{'num_tokens_scored': 135, 'num_green_tokens': 107, 'green_fraction': 0.7925925925925926, 'z_score': 6.799237430008577, 'p_value': 5.258718077855404e-12, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([-1.0000, -1.4142, -1.7321, -1.0000, -0.4472,  0.0000,  0.3780,  0.7071,

7860,"Chattanooga Railway. In a city famous for its ``choo choos,'' the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is billed as the world's steepest. Back in the 1880s, a group of Chattanooga businessmen built an elaborate hotel just below a famous point on Lookout Mountain. To convey guests to the hotel, they built a narrow-guage railway up the side of the mountain. Today the hotel is long gone, but the railway remains, and it gives passengers the chance to see one of Tennessee's most impressive views.

Nearly 2,000 Americans were turned away at French borders this year for not having visas. To enter France, you must get a visa - a stamp in your passport showing it has been examined by the proper officals of that country - before you go. You'll need a valid passport, $15, one passport-sized photo of yourself, and an application form completed and signed. Visas are issued on the spot if you apply in person; by mail it takes up to three weeks. A visa is valid for three years and permits you to stay up to 90 days at a time. For application and instructions, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the French Consulate in your region or to the French Embassy, 4101 Reservoir Rd. N.W., Washington, DC 20007.
Memorize your passport number. You'll need it when you cash a traveler's check, fill out a customs form, or register at a hotel.
Take a sweater. Even if you're traveling in a tropical hot spot, an air-conditioned bus or restaurant may be uncomfortably chilly.
Don't automatically change your dollars to local currency. Many cities will take those dollars, and it saves constant switching back and forth to new money.
Take an umbrella. Hopefully it won't rain. If you're touring by bus, rack it there.
Use a camera that offers control over flash. You'll get more pictures. Often it's the flash, not the picture taking, that's objectionable.
Coordinate your watch with your guide's. If you don't, and your watch is slow, you may get left behind.

3185,"The third season of Sons of Anarchy saw the motorcycle gang travel to Ireland and back, and ended with many of them going to prison. But while Jax (Charlie Hunnam) and Clay (Ron Perlman) patch up their relationship in jail, Tara finds out that Jax's deceased father and former leader of the motorcycle club feared that he would be killed by Clay and Gemma. We asked SOA creator Kurt Sutter about where he wants to take the fourth season, and when viewers can expect the crap to hit the fan.
TV Guide Magazine: What was the feedback you got for the third season?
Sutter: It's been primarily good. It's always a risk when you take your guys out of their main environment and I think when we went to Ireland people started wondering what that was about, but I think once we started to reveal the mythology about why we were going to Ireland and the weight of that on Jax. I saw that one of the sites was picking their favorite season and oddly enough Season 3 was up by three or four percent over season 2. So overall I think there was something fascinating about the scope of it, and going out of their environment. I love revealing the mythology, I love the whole IRA connection and the thematic weight of that. I'm a history guy, so there's a part of me that was digging on that.
TV Guide Magazine: Where do you see the fourth season going? Do you see more focus being placed on what happened to John?
Sutter: I think that always looms out there for Jax and I think the information he got this season will continue to impact him. But I think Season 4 will really be about dealing with the ramifications of all that new information, and it's a different Charming that they're coming back to. It's a different gun business for them. The 21st Century really starts to creep into the town and into the club.
TV Guide Magazine: What does that mean, specifically?
Sutter: I think ultimately there's a lot more progress in the town with Hale now becoming mayor there'll be a lot more development in the town. All the things they've been trying to avoid for years will ultimately start to creep in. If they can't keep Charming contained anymore, how do they deal with that?
TV Guide Magazine: Are you tempted to make it more about Clay and Jax and Gemma?
Sutter: I think ultimately, it is about the three of them and everything sort of is either background or devices to complicate all those relationships. I think Clay has a personal connection with Charming and there's something about the karmic weight of if he can keep that"," town small and safe, everything else we do is OK. So I think it's important for Clay to maintain that relationship with Charming. So it will be interesting to see how he deals with that this season.
TV Guide Magazine: I assume there will be another confrontation between Clay and Jax at some point.
Sutter: At some point. I think it's interesting that we opened those wounds up in Season 2 and then let them heal over in Season 3. I think one of the most powerful moments of the season for people was in the finale when Clay says to jax, 'I love you, son.'

7934,"NEWARK – Filling out his Winnipeg Jets lineup card has probably never been tougher for head coach Paul Maurice than it is right now.
That job only figures to become more challenging later this month with the expected return of defenceman Jacob Trouba and centre Adam Lowry from injury.
As the Jets get face to face the New York Rangers on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, Maurice isn’t planning to make any lineup changes after his team has posted consecutive victories to improve to 39-17-9 on the season.
Jets forward Brandon Tanev missed 10 consecutive games with an upper-body injury, but is expected to be a healthy scratch for the second contest in a row.
Just how does Maurice strike the balance between not wanting to change things up and finding room for a player that was an effective player for the Jets prior to the injury?
“That is a really good question and I’m working on that,” Maurice said after the Jets skated at the New Jersey Devils practice rink on Monday afternoon. “Fairly soon, if everything plays out, we’re going to have four extra healthy forwards that have all played for us.
Starting with training camp, the competition to both stay in the lineup and earn more ice time began in earnest.
But as injuries and opportunities occurred over the course of the season, youngsters like Kyle Connor and later Jack Roslovic have not just established themselves as regulars – they’re making an important contribution on the top two lines.
Connor is actually third on the Jets in goals (22) and sixth in points (41), which is even more impressive when you consider he started in the AHL and missed the first six games.
The addition of veteran centre Paul Stastny gave the Jets even more strength down the middle.
And after starting the campaign with what was basically a top-six and bottom-six forward group, the Jets have evolved into a team that features three scoring lines and a checking line, albeit one that can also chip in offensively.
Having that type of depth is a luxury the Jets haven’t really enjoyed during the six previous seasons.
It makes them a dangerous group to contend with and opposition coaches are being forced to make tough choices when it comes to which line to play the top defence pairing against.
Do you load up and try to contain Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler or do you send the shutdown group out against Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers?
And don’t forget about veterans like Little and Mathieu Perreault.
It essentially becomes a bit of a pick your poison situation.
Internal competition can be a driving force and bring out the best in players.
It can also make life difficult for those on the outside looking in – especially for guys who had been carving out a role like Tanev, as a penalty killer who uses his speed to create havoc on the forecheck.
The goal for every team is to win,"," but those clubs who are often the most successful find a way to make the necessary personal sacrifices while working hard enough to be ready whenever their number is called.
Winning often makes being a healthy scratch a bit more palatable, even though it’s never easy to accept.
“If you’re out of the lineup, obviously you want to be and be playing and be a part of it but for a team, it’s a good thing to have,” said Little. “The depth is so deep that you have good players out of your lineup and good players that are fighting for ice time and trying to get in. We can someone up and they’re NHL ready right off the bat and we’ve got guys fighting for spots in the lineup. We still have guys on the (Manitoba) Moose right now that aren’t even here that can probably step in pretty soon and be a player on this team.",814,614,200,39.52972340583801,76.00900292396545,"[[0.8396127223968506, 0.9610005617141724, 0.9204744696617126, 0.8491806983947754, 0.5677798390388489, 0.5687612295150757, 0.9661253690719604, 0.9519691467285156, 0.8621248602867126, 0.5699408054351807, 0.96962571144104, 0.8974518179893494, 0.9806859493255615, 0.9654384255409241, 0.9386487603187561, 0.8916655778884888, 0.7400619983673096, 0.726661741733551, 0.808781623840332, 0.9461726546287537, 0.8853148221969604, 0.9281723499298096, 0.9259079098701477, 0.578874409198761, 0.9599681496620178, 0.9253846406936646, 0.933158814907074, 0.5893369317054749, 0.9069206714630127, 0.5684496760368347, 0.9407563209533691, 0.8970552086830139, 0.5741280317306519, 0.5677140355110168, 0.5676702857017517, 0.875939667224884, 0.923062801361084, 0.7708470225334167, 0.9668536186218262, 0.9620069265365601, 0.568086564540863, 0.5680491328239441, 0.833280086517334, 0.9332773089408875, 0.9108681678771973, 0.8494824171066284, 0.9537051320075989, 0.9657976031303406, 0.7603086829185486, 0.9088266491889954, 0.9093666076660156, 0.9554224014282227, 0.9714939594268799, 0.9535677433013916, 0.8209164142608643, 0.5996279716491699, 0.7638306617736816, 0.8134251832962036, 0.8778612613677979, 0.9576286673545837, 0.5689826607704163, 0.7787348031997681, 0.9688050150871277, 0.8977547883987427, 0.8407214283943176, 0.9447281956672668, 0.5695589184761047, 0.66107177734375, 0.8636161684989929, 0.7716466784477234, 0.8749607801437378, 0.6452317237854004, 0.5695415139198303, 0.5865485668182373, 0.5827418565750122, 0.6453280448913574, 0.6318591833114624, 0.5683214068412781, 0.9371036291122437, 0.9269879460334778, 0.8972656726837158, 0.940517008304596, 0.9756466150283813, 0.8131788969039917, 0.9133849740028381, 0.9659386277198792, 0.9100733399391174, 0.7242984175682068, 0.9349195957183838, 0.5917453169822693, 0.834144115447998, 0.8319056034088135, 0.5827390551567078, 0.567894697189331, 0.9390652179718018, 0.975401759147644, 0.918365478515625, 0.9298895597457886, 0.8957330584526062, 0.8376961350440979, 0.5906953811645508, 0.896439790725708, 0.8496606945991516, 0.8029743432998657, 0.596749484539032, 0.8846406936645508, 0.8730787038803101, 0.8406440615653992, 0.797760546207428, 0.9525808691978455, 0.9173619151115417, 0.5677124857902527, 0.7891485095024109, 0.8699123859405518, 0.8987612128257751, 0.9261401891708374, 0.8881507515907288, 0.8570597171783447, 0.953674852848053, 0.8701527714729309, 0.8971555233001709, 0.8884506225585938, 0.5690089464187622, 0.7643203139305115, 0.7774792313575745, 0.5680788159370422, 0.6006562113761902, 0.9760794639587402, 0.9100093245506287, 0.9405430555343628, 0.9703846573829651, 0.9507973790168762, 0.9815802574157715, 0.8455688953399658, 0.7518115639686584, 0.9751284718513489, 0.9618141055107117, 0.5690140128135681, 0.9405500292778015, 0.9591571092605591, 0.9317060708999634, 0.8394337296485901, 0.938892126083374, 0.618918776512146, 0.8159546852111816, 0.8683914542198181, 0.964260458946228, 0.8880061507225037, 0.5677018165588379, 0.5689411759376526, 0.8987764716148376, 0.8874949812889099, 0.9228790402412415, 0.852914035320282, 0.5676758885383606, 0.5787433385848999, 0.933021068572998, 0.8485820293426514, 0.9432682394981384, 0.9089937210083008, 0.9605536460876465, 0.9251752495765686, 0.7428187727928162, 0.8580049872398376, 0.7451137900352478, 0.7972186207771301, 0.6255316138267517, 0.7404657602310181, 0.8809959292411804, 0.888015866279602, 0.8061952590942383, 0.9806889891624451, 0.9099886417388916, 0.7040554285049438, 0.7689948081970215, 0.8082022666931152, 0.9508867263793945, 0.597619891166687, 0.931860625743866, 0.9547248482704163, 0.8887103796005249, 0.756559431552887, 0.7708184719085693, 0.6453680396080017, 0.7286690473556519, 0.6308406591415405, 0.584445059299469, 0.9568345546722412, 0.7141392827033997, 0.9851425886154175, 0.9856981635093689, 0.8986997008323669, 0.5690776109695435, 0.8233122825622559, 0.9759992361068726, 0.9268859624862671, 0.9020887613296509, 0.904406726360321, 0.9559412598609924, 0.9056898355484009]]"," but sometimes those battles can take a mental toll on players.
“Well, I think that’s part of the game,” Maurice said. “You have to deal with it. You have to handle it and you have to learn from it.
“It’s not always easy to deal with that and it’s not always easy to be in that position. But for me, I’m not going to try and change it or take it as a personal slight or anything like that.
“I’m trying to look at it from the standpoint of, ‘OK, if I’m going to be healthy, I have to do the best I can with what I have and do the best I can with how we’ve been playing.’
“And if we can get healthy and get some more healthy, I think that’s going to help us a lot.”"," but sometimes it’s just a matter of how the players are positioned in the lineup and whether Maurice is willing to use them.
“I don’t think so (about Tanev) because he is a guy who has been a real important member of our team and part of our defensive corps and part of our penalty killing,” Maurice said. “So we would never sit him and not have him out there.
“The best players will be out there when you need them in the game and we’ve got some players that are in that situation right now.”
The Jets have certainly been fortunate to have a wealth of forwards available to them this season, but there’s no doubt it’s been a challenge to balance it out on the back end, especially given the current injury situation and the adding of three more healthy forwards to the mix.

9583,"The Bears already made one major move to strengthen the offensive line when they signed left tackle Jermon Bushrod. This will create competition at right tackle, as Gabe Carimi and J'Marcus Webb will each push to earn the starting job. But the Bears still need to think about guards, and that's one area they can address with the draft.
Chance Warmack from Alabama is one of the best options for the Bears out of the draft. As a 6-foot-2, 317-lb. guard, he could fill holes in the Bears' interior line. He is known as a"," powerful run blocker, which would make Matt Forte quite happy.
The National Football Post says he has a nasty edge to his game, which the Bears line has been lacking since Olin Kreutz left the team. Part of keeping the quarterback safe means punishing the defenders who dare lay a hand on him. Warmack has the game to make it happen.
And it's not a bad idea for the Bears to bring in young, fresh talent on the interior. Lance Louis is a free agent who is coming off an ACL tear, and he still may not return. Roberto Garza just turned 34, and Chris Spencer and James Brown aren't as reliable the Bears need them to be.
Plus, that name! Think of all the headlines we can come up with the name Chance Warmack. It's a great, great football name that would fit well on the back of a Bears jersey. If he's available when the Bears pick at 20, Warmack would make sense for Chicago.",321,121,200,30.423049449920654,35.06833863258362,"[[0.9753017425537109, 0.7213445901870728, 0.8362787961959839, 0.9572030305862427, 0.9011824727058411, 0.7415813207626343, 0.7649534344673157, 0.7947806119918823, 0.9007399082183838, 0.567719042301178, 0.9449741244316101, 0.9662438631057739, 0.9830179810523987, 0.7455975413322449, 0.8449307084083557, 0.8401062488555908, 0.9303086400032043, 0.6236509680747986, 0.6393717527389526, 0.6391553282737732, 0.876681923866272, 0.8435850143432617, 0.9294436573982239, 0.6323562264442444, 0.8984404802322388, 0.926108181476593, 0.9569331407546997, 0.5694251656532288, 0.8953894376754761, 0.6929860711097717, 0.9218544363975525, 0.6455456614494324, 0.870800256729126, 0.7072142362594604, 0.742313027381897, 0.7630230188369751, 0.9770748615264893, 0.8466141223907471, 0.9411556720733643, 0.9639168977737427, 0.5890482664108276, 0.9377886652946472, 0.9009203314781189, 0.8491588830947876, 0.9213078022003174, 0.5682010650634766, 0.8152426481246948, 0.6755210757255554, 0.7687538862228394, 0.8393561840057373, 0.9417814612388611, 0.9404579401016235, 0.9682268500328064, 0.9520774483680725, 0.6605818271636963, 0.7356098890304565, 0.824203610420227, 0.8027164936065674, 0.9567941427230835, 0.9018499851226807, 0.7419658899307251, 0.8170230388641357, 0.7160685658454895, 0.6633135676383972, 0.6370993852615356, 0.8365239500999451, 0.8257559537887573, 0.7189269065856934, 0.5791106820106506, 0.9576202630996704, 0.9570987820625305, 0.863156259059906, 0.7104198336601257, 0.9494633674621582, 0.9049292802810669, 0.9035117626190186, 0.9218297600746155, 0.9506071209907532, 0.8541508913040161, 0.8058138489723206, 0.9122739434242249, 0.8820827007293701, 0.895470142364502, 0.8652540445327759, 0.8394082188606262, 0.8477162718772888, 0.6860665678977966, 0.8797570466995239, 0.8080366849899292, 0.813280463218689, 0.567724883556366, 0.910853922367096, 0.8868228197097778, 0.8661242723464966, 0.9144171476364136, 0.9063082337379456, 0.8898716568946838, 0.9313123822212219, 0.9073214530944824, 0.9288800358772278, 0.7712175250053406, 0.7365847229957581, 0.8028045892715454]]"," powerful player with good pad level and a strong, versatile run blocker. Warmack is a reliable player who has been consistent at Alabama.
Spencer Pulley is another option. He is a more experienced player with better size (6-foot-5, 315-lb.) than Warm Carroll but is a slightly older prospect (26 years old) who is also more projectable in his game. Pulley would fill a critical need for the Bears, as he is a strong run blocker but would likely be a project as a pass blocker.
Dylan Moses is a player who the Bears could look at in the second to third rounds. Moses is a more physical player than Warmack, but he is also a little more raw, and he is a little more projectable. He is also slightly older than Warmack, which could slow him down a bit. It's possible the Bears target a guard to start right away and then address the rest of the team later in the draft."," run blocker and a solid pass protector. Warmack has a shot to be a first-round pick, and the Bears should be able to get him in the middle rounds.
The Bears' offensive line struggled to protect Jay Cutler last season, and it's a big reason why the Bears fell short of the playoffs for the third consecutive season. They will need to improve the line to fix it. The draft is a good place to start. Warmack is the best available option to help them at guard.",200,103,0.15211524724960326,0.3404693071124623,"{'num_tokens_scored': 99, 'num_green_tokens': 70, 'green_fraction': 0.7070707070707071, 'z_score': 4.1206550425627695, 'p_value': 1.8889836392667065e-05, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([1.0000, 1.4142, 0.5774, 1.0000, 0.4472, 0.8165, 0.3780, 0.7071, 1.0000,

It’s been a busy six months for Municipal Affairs Minister Chuck Porter, who took over the helm of the department in early July 2018.
“Municipal Affairs is a busy spot. There is a lot going on,” he told the Valley Harvester in early January. Porter’s portfolio includes the Office of the Fire Marshal, as well as the Emergency Management Office (EMO).
“Being minister for the entire province and not just one area can take a bit to get your head around when you’re passionate about the issues happening at home in your own constituency, but the key is to treat everyone the same. There is a variety of challenges among the municipalities, but also a lot of similar challenges and they’re all trying to operate on their tax base,” he said.
Porter said he encourages collaboration among municipalities so they can get the most bang for their bucks, but is trying not to put too much pressure on them after facilitating the special legislation consolidating Windsor and West Hants. So far, no other unit has requested consolidation legislation, but Porter isn’t ruling anything out.
Some councillors across the region had expressed concerns over the other legislation Porter brought to the Nova Scotia legislature in the fall: Bill 58, which requires municipalities to share their planning with neighbouring units. That doesn’t equal needing their permission, said Porter.
While he’s not in a position to share what legislation is coming forward in the house of assembly’s spring session, Porter said priorities the department has include revamping the Municipal Government Act and looking at changes to the Capped Assessment Program (CAP), which establishes a ceiling on what the amounts residential property assessments can increase annually. “There’s been a lot of talk about the unfairness of it, so maybe there is a better formula,” said Porter.
Challenges have a greater chance of creating more opportunities, but going into a new year there are still some lingering, costly problems, such as the inter-municipal service agreement that created Valley Waste Resource Management. “I can’t really comment on it because it’s still before the courts, but I’m staying on the positive side that it will all work out,” said Porter.
Just before Christmas last year, Valley Waste Resource Management was cleared by the RCMP following a complaint from the County of Annapolis at the end of July.
“Valley Waste was never advised as to the nature of the complaint,” said communications manager Andrew Garrett in"," a statement. But Valley Waste Resource Management continues to be in a precarious financial position with more than $800,000 plus interest it says it is owed by the County of Annapolis for services between April 1 and Aug. 17, 2018. Valley Waste Resource Management still has control of its transfer station on Elliot Road, while the county appeals a decision from the judicial review concerning its expropriation that was handed down in late November.
County of Kings Mayor Peter Muttart said in an email the cost of the “break-up” has yet to be determined and arbitration the province offered to pay for is not an option if the other party does not agree to it. “The alternative to binding arbitration is expensive court procedures,” he said, adding that the appeal may not be heard until the spring.
In the meantime, remaining municipal partners will be reviewing the Valley Waste Resource Management 2019-2020 budget for cost savings to cover a 17 per cent increase to them.",744,544,200,38.12352633476257,74.48515248298645,"[[0.7859602570533752, 0.6659433841705322, 0.8065665364265442, 0.6205215454101562, 0.7662439942359924, 0.5706994533538818, 0.5721040964126587, 0.5677103400230408, 0.7615549564361572, 0.7859609127044678, 0.5682135224342346, 0.9511162042617798, 0.9429632425308228, 0.9626516103744507, 0.7853891253471375, 0.8351686596870422, 0.8292832970619202, 0.9470297694206238, 0.8933197259902954, 0.9250500202178955, 0.7895619869232178, 0.7973112463951111, 0.8712782859802246, 0.9535706639289856, 0.6282951235771179, 0.7697231769561768, 0.890486478805542, 0.920881450176239, 0.8606140613555908, 0.6614238023757935, 0.9441565275192261, 0.6795137524604797, 0.7335638999938965, 0.7325546145439148, 0.856309711933136, 0.8878540396690369, 0.5679018497467041, 0.6790440082550049, 0.9477415680885315, 0.8902994990348816, 0.9583443403244019, 0.8829765319824219, 0.799968421459198, 0.7522175312042236, 0.9588514566421509, 0.6962968111038208, 0.8800054788589478, 0.9591583609580994, 0.9690389633178711, 0.5677488446235657, 0.5678037405014038, 0.8998043537139893, 0.9357744455337524, 0.9456443786621094, 0.9077478647232056, 0.8598577380180359, 0.9492529630661011, 0.8885074257850647, 0.6172095537185669, 0.7996634244918823, 0.8952364921569824, 0.6829365491867065, 0.6590970754623413, 0.8250225782394409, 0.9251537322998047, 0.5683000683784485, 0.9415014982223511, 0.8499636054039001, 0.5676940679550171, 0.568579912185669, 0.955743134021759, 0.8977112770080566, 0.9435623288154602, 0.8162308931350708, 0.9192527532577515, 0.921978235244751, 0.5719705820083618, 0.8502200841903687, 0.8324422836303711, 0.9490305781364441, 0.7928680181503296, 0.5676803588867188, 0.5698862671852112, 0.9338330626487732, 0.7990846037864685, 0.8573256731033325, 0.6992595195770264, 0.5997653603553772, 0.7679909467697144, 0.9374944567680359, 0.8476078510284424, 0.7042797207832336, 0.5678562521934509, 0.7396810054779053, 0.643385112285614, 0.596838653087616, 0.7745888233184814, 0.5682454705238342, 0.9237003326416016, 0.9176850914955139, 0.9399349093437195, 0.9176517128944397, 0.9794125556945801, 0.9722093343734741, 0.7907483577728271, 0.8743223547935486, 0.6454777121543884, 0.8365838527679443, 0.8807834386825562, 0.9455817937850952, 0.8815780282020569, 0.5677232146263123, 0.6221027970314026, 0.9009209871292114, 0.8108259439468384, 0.9249688982963562, 0.9003228545188904, 0.5676872730255127, 0.5869860053062439, 0.7879687547683716, 0.568799614906311, 0.7307676076889038, 0.9624719023704529, 0.592802107334137, 0.635526716709137, 0.6431357860565186, 0.5677737593650818, 0.6376408934593201, 0.9728373289108276, 0.9757298231124878, 0.9554760456085205, 0.9653369188308716, 0.9735093116760254, 0.8737867474555969, 0.7185142636299133, 0.7344323992729187, 0.9371582269668579, 0.9639987945556641, 0.7973238229751587, 0.8841284513473511, 0.9291285872459412, 0.9255510568618774, 0.5785033702850342, 0.9800395369529724, 0.9434925317764282, 0.9392914175987244, 0.9657440185546875, 0.9162859320640564, 0.9333800673484802, 0.874408483505249, 0.7418937087059021, 0.571903645992279, 0.9779602885246277, 0.8535763025283813, 0.8872177004814148, 0.9103084802627563, 0.8570281267166138, 0.8492705821990967, 0.9318769574165344, 0.9258895516395569, 0.9773293137550354, 0.9885611534118652, 0.5705099105834961, 0.8716154098510742, 0.9916824102401733, 0.8809270262718201, 0.9479526281356812, 0.8108643889427185, 0.6884905099868774, 0.5882412791252136, 0.5684272646903992, 0.8654226064682007, 0.8527112007141113, 0.8256238102912903, 0.5731567144393921, 0.8838695883750916, 0.567989706993103, 0.5679198503494263, 0.9868869185447693, 0.6396946310997009, 0.9792483448982239, 0.9461434483528137, 0.9290089011192322, 0.925125241279602, 0.9000450372695923, 0.841661274433136, 0.7795619964599609, 0.569897472858429, 0.8159232139587402, 0.5827305912971497, 0.8535704612731934, 0.5724794864654541, 0.9320172071456909, 0.963708758354187, 0.9592121839523315, 0.8557843565940857, 0.5951378345489502, 0.6833112239837646, 0.9177480936050415, 0.5774586796760559]]"," an email. “As the investigation was ongoing, we could not provide any further details.”
According to outgoing Chief Administrative Officer, Karen Edwards, the complaint was based on correspondence between an unnamed town and the company.
“The Town of Rothesay never communicated any concern to Valley Waste Resource Management regarding the alleged complaint,” she said in an email.
Valley Waste was cleared of any wrongdoing, but the company and former town resident Wayne Browning were charged with five counts under the Municipal Act regarding alleged breaches of the inter-municipal service agreement. Browning’s lawyer, David Bailey, said they will plead not guilty.
“We’re not going to be taken into custody and charged with anything,” said Bailey, adding he’s confident the charges will be dropped. “I think the Crown will decide they don’t have the evidence to go the next step.”
Porter said"," an email to The Valley Harvester. “We were contacted by county staff on July 27, 2018 who informed us that the complaint had been escalated to the RCMP.”
Though the complaint has not been resolved, the RCMP’s investigation has been ongoing for about six months, Garrett confirmed.
“It’s been a lengthy time for Valley Waste, and it’s been a lengthy time for the municipality,” he added. “I think people are just waiting for a resolution, and I’m not sure that’s going to be anytime soon.”
The county has been on the hook for a substantial sum to help Valley Waste, but the department is in the process of negotiating a new agreement. The issue is a result of a court challenge the County of Annapolis made to Valley Waste’s decision to consolidate its waste collection services. According to Garrett, Valley Waste is still on the hook for more than",200,200,0.19061763167381288,0.37242576241493225,"{'num_tokens_scored': 190, 'num_green_tokens': 144, 'green_fraction': 0.7578947368421053, 'z_score': 7.109667251078115, 'p_value': 5.816153003276853e-13, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.0000,  1.4142,  1.7321,  1.0000,  0.4472,  0.0000, -0.3780,  0.0000,

5556,"FOUR of Diamonds have defended Honey G after they lost out on their place on the X Factor last night – while the controversial rapper was saved.
The girl group insisted Honey – real name Anna Guildford – “deserved” her place in the music contest as she works so hard.
The band - made up of Caroline, Lauren, Yasmin and Sophia - have also jumped to the defence of mentor Louis Walsh, insisting they couldn’t wish for a more “caring” judge.
And asked about Honey G being kept in the competition, despite furious backlash from viewers, they told us: “We all love Honey G, she’s great and she works so hard. She deserves her place as much as anyone else in the competition now.
And it’s not just Honey they’re full of praise for, as despite claims there had been tension with mentor Louis, all four girls couldn’t gush about him more.
“Louis doesn’t get enough credit as a mentor, he is so lovely to work with and he’s so caring,” Lauren told us.
“We spend so much time with him, we have his number, we used to call and text him all the time… He really cares, and I don’t think many people see that side of him.
The girl group got off to a rocky start on the live shows, as they were brought in to replace Brooks Way at the last minute, as the"," duo quit amid assault allegations.
Four of Diamonds broke down in tears ahead of the performance on Saturday over negative comments they had received online, after they were saved over singer Gifty Louise.
The Sun exclusively revealed previously that the band had been formed in a workshop, after all four girls auditioned as solo artists.
And explaining exactly how it happened, Caroline revealed: “We had our producers audition, and interviewed as solo artists, then management company got involved which was separate from the show got in touch, and they put us together at a workshop, before we met the judges as a group.
While Ryan Lawrie and Emily Middlemas are more loved up than ever, Lauren admitted there’s no other romances in the house.

But they quickly made a name for themselves, covering one of Louis’s favourite songs, Heartbreak on the Dancefloor.
And now they’re determined to bring the X Factor back to the UK.
“We’d love to take the X Factor back to the UK but we’d have to start from scratch,” Lauren added.
“We would love to do it with Louis Walsh, he would bring so much more to the show than just the judges,” she added.
“Louis is a big part of the show, he’s got a massive impact on the show and it wouldn’t be the same without him,” Lauren said.
“He’s so caring, and he’s just such a nice person,” she added.
And Caroline added: “I"," original line-up were left injured, but have since been performing consistently well and are now guaranteed a place in the semi-finals.
The girls also said that Louis Walsh is the “best mentor” they could have asked for, adding: “We couldn’t ask for a more caring judge.
“And he’s so kind to work with, he’s so lovely to everyone.”
Lauren – who was mentored by Louis himself – said of his advice: “It’s always helpful to get your opinion on something.”

4410,"Churchville-Chili swimmers Tyler Regelsberger and Brandon Crist set sights on making an impact at states.
Churchville-Chili seniors Brandon Crist and Tyler Regelsberger are Section V’s dynamic duo, the Batman and Robin of Section V boys swimming.
Who’s who is up for debate.
They both wear goggles like Robin's mask, but have builds like Batman. “The Boy Wonder” would serve as a fitting nickname for either.
Regelsberger disagrees with Crist, showcasing a less diplomatic version of The Caped Crusader.
One thing is certain, the 2017 Democrat and Chronicle All-Greater Rochester boys swimming selections have put together “super” performances this season.
The dynamic duo, who are also second cousins, have a combined nine top-four times across seven individual events and are members of a pair of Saints’ top-six relay times.
Regelsberger has recorded a top-three or better performance in five individual events this season. His 100-yard freestyle (48.31) performance is second-best in Section V, while his 200 freestyle (1:46.51), 200 individual medley (2:00.82), 50 freestyle (22.08) and 100 breast stroke (1:01.87) times are No. 3.
For the 100 butterfly (54.65) and 500 freestyle (4:52.12), his performances are good for No. 9 and No. 6, respectively.
His 50, 100, 200 and 500 freestyle times are state-meet qualifiers.
Not to be outdone, Crist has four top-four individual performances, including a Section V-best performance in the 500 freestyle (4:34.79). He has the No. 2 time in the 200 freestyle (1:44.33) and the No. 4 time in the 100 freestyle (49.09) and 100 butterfly (53.72).
His 100 backstroke (57.02) is ninth-best in Section V, while his 50 freestyle (22.64) is top-10 and 200 individual medley (2:07.53) is good for No. 13.
His 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle and 100 butterfly times are good enough to qualify for states.
The pair also regularly participate in the Saints’ 200 and 400 freestyle relays, with the fifth-best sectional time in the 400 (3:28.06) and sixth-best time in the 200 freestyle (1:35.07).
As for whether Batman would better serve as a lead or anchor, Regelsberger sees himself as a “lead-the-charge” version of the Bat.
Crist’s Dark Knight is more of a “save-the-day” type.
Except for Crist’s 500 freestyle, there are more than a number of second-bests and third-bests. Enter Pittsford",", whose program and individual dominance in the pool provides Churchville-Chili’s Dynamic Duo with their own personal Legion of Doom to battle against. Name an individual event or relay, and odds are a Panther tops the list.
Pittsford sits atop the latest Democrat and Chronicle’s large-schools swimming poll, whereas the Saints were left off, despite the efforts of Regelsberger and Crist. This isn’t the result the pair envisioned at the start of their final high school season, but are doing everything they can to unify their team and help it succeed.
As team leaders, much of the responsibility falls on the Saints’ standout seniors.
It will take a super-human effort to get Churchville-Chili back into the Class A team sectionals picture, but Regelsberger and Crist have the talent to pull it off.

Regelsberger and Crist are on pace to become the first-ever co-swimming state champions since 1999, when the Saints won the sectional title and advanced to state. In 2000, the Saints won the sectional title but did not advance to states.
That’s not a huge accomplishment for a team that has had more seasons without Elvis Duran (2000-02, 2011-12) and Jimmy Rizzuto (2014-16) than any other sectional champion. Crist and Regelsberger are the only Saints’ swimmers who have won a sectional title or placed in the sectional top eight since those teams were defeated by Monroe Academy in 2006 and Syracuse in 2011, respectively.
“I think we’ve done a really good job this season of coming together as a team and pushing each other to get better,” Regelsberger said.

2547,"A teenage health crisis led Surbhi Sarna to found a company aimed at detecting ovarian cancer early. Today Boston Scientific is purchasing the startup firm for up to $275 million.
A quest to detect ovarian cancer for other women led Sarna, 32, to found a company, nVision Medical of San Bruno, Calif., to raise $17 million in venture capital, and to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration to develop a specialized device for detecting ovarian cancer. (The device is not yet for sale.) Now Boston Scientific, the Marlborough, Mass.-based medical device giant, says it will buy nVision for $150 million upfront and another $125 million to be paid if certain clinical and commercial milestones are hit over the next four years. Sarna, who was on Forbes' 30 Under 30 In Healthcare list in 2014, plans to remain with the company.
""I did not start this company because I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I was looking for some concept,"" says Sarna. ""I did not start this company because I wanted to be a CEO or I wanted to be in charge. Those were all necessary things that I needed to do to get this product to where it needed to go. Now, this is the best place for me to be in order to keep seeing that happen.""
The market opportunity for the device could be from $500 million to $2 billion annually, says David Pierce, an executive vice president at Boston Scientific and president of the company's MedSurg division. Some 300,000 women have their ovaries removed each year, he says, mostly because they either have suspicious masses on them or because they carry a version of the BRCA gene that makes them very likely to develop cancer. The nVision device aims to give doctors a way to watch for cancer in these patients. ""We're really excited about this acquisition,"" Pierce says. ""The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is a massive unmet need in this space."" The deal could be accretive to Boston Scientific's earnings as soon as 2020.
Sarna is the daughter of Indian immigrants. Her mother, a Ph.D. in Hindi literature, stayed home to raise her children. Her father, an engineer, worked at a series of startups. She founded nVision straight out of college in 2009, continuing to work day jobs in the medical device industry. She had few connections, and often met with deaf ears. ""I've been in several boardrooms with all male VCs who are like, 'Oh. This is a women's issue,"" she says.
After a year and a half, she managed to raise $250,000. Her biggest backer was Darshana Zaveri, a woman who was a partner at Catalyst Health Ventures. Sarna hired an engineer named David Snow, who had been her boss at her last medical device job. Together they faced a huge engineering challenge. They needed to collect cells from the Fallopian tubes, which lead from the ovaries to the uterus. But these tubes, Sarna says, are a millimeter wide, between four and 12 centimeters long, and have, in he words, ""the consistency of wet paper towel."" Trying to push a catheter through them would risk damaging that delicate tissue.
Their solution? A balloon, which would follow the path up the Fallopian tube as it inflated, and would collect the cells on its surface. nVision conducted an initial 40-woman study to see if it could get the balloon into the Fallopian tube, and a second 40-woman study to prove that it could enter the full length of the tube and collect cells. A third study of woman who were having their ovaries removed compared the results of looking at the cells with the pathology reports on the ovaries to see if it could detect cancer. The results have not been published, but Sarna and Pierce both say that the test had high sensitivity and specificity. Contractually, the outside doctors who conducted the research have the right to be the first to release the results.
As nVision's product moved forward, investors became more interested. Astia Angels, an angel investing group, backed her, as did Michigan's Arboretum Ventures, which led a $12 million series B. She remembers first sitting down with a team from Boston Scientific at a medical meeting in Las Vegas several years ago. It was the end of the day, and they were all tired, but she remember the team's excitement. ""You know when someone just really gets something and understands it right away?"" she says. ""It was awesome.""
Last summer potential acquirers started expressing interest in the company. Sarna says she was in no hurry. Half her series B had not been spent, and Arboretum had set aside cash for another investment round. Boston Scientific was one potential buyer. But the meetings went so well that, at one point in negotiations, Sarna told a Boston Scientific executive: ""Hey. My team really likes your team."" She says she was thrilled that Boston is the company acquiring nVision. Thursday, two members of the Boston Scientific team flew across the country to take her to dinner at Octavia, an award-winning San Francisco Restaurant, where they ate steak and deviled eggs and talked for six hours. Her husband, an"," entrepreneur whose startup recently raised $60 million, was baffled that anyone could talk about work for so long.
The challenge will be convincing women and their doctors that it really is safe to watch for cancer using nVision's test. Boston Scientific plans a larger, 120-patient study. But Sarna says that women are already in a position of waiting and watching, and choosing to balance the health costs of removing their ovaries and going into early menopause and sacrificing some of their childbearing years with the risk of cancer. She says she wants to give them a better option than existing diagnostics, which she scoffs are no better than flipping a coin.

In 2013 it set up the Boston Scientific Women's Entrepreneurship Fund, and has invested in more than 55 women-owned businesses since its inception. The company is now the fourth largest U.S. employer of women, with more than 57,000 employees. The deal is expected to close in the coming weeks.

""The idea of leaving is just so far out of my comfort zone,"" she says.
Sarna has been working on a version of the nVision device since September 2014 venues
The nVision team is excited to get to work on the next version of the device. They hope to start a clinical study of it next year and hope to move into early-stage clinical trials by early 2017. ""The testing is going to start off with the FDA, which is a whole lot of paperwork, but it's going to get easier from there,"" says Pierce. The company is working to develop a more advanced version of the device. It will likely sell for $5,000, a fraction of what is currently sold to patients for this test, Pierce says.

8970,"Viacom Inc.'s chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, is expected to tell investors and analysts at an industry conference in California today that his company will put most of Simon & Schuster, its $2 billion publishing operation, up for sale, people involved in the sale said yesterday.
Simon & Schuster's educational publishing businesses will most likely be put on the block. But Viacom is expected to hold onto the Simon & Schuster trade imprint, which has published such recent best sellers as ''Diana: Her True Story -- In Her Own Words,'' by Andrew Morton; ''The Christmas Box,'' by Richard Paul Evans, and ''Wait Till Next Year,'' by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company is said to have been hired to handle the sale, which analysts say could fetch $4 billion to $4.5 billion.
A Viacom spokesman declined to comment.
A Simon & Schuster sale has long been expected. Ever since Viacom acquired Paramount Communications in 1994, Mr. Redstone has shown little interest in the publishing operations.
When Paramount was independent, the book business assured steady earnings to stabilize the more volatile movie and television operations. But after the merger, Viacom's cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, offered the same type of stability and more opportunities for entertainment programming and marketing. The profit margins for the cable network business are also far higher.
The educational publishing division does, however, own some fast-growing operations, including Computer Curriculum Publishing, which provides computer programs for schools, and the Educational Management Group, which delivers live interactive custom curriculums to two million students in 4,000 schools.
It is not clear yet whether the Simon & Schuster businesses would be sold in pieces or as a whole.
Educational publishers like McGraw-Hill and Harcourt Brace might be interested in acquiring the kindergarden-through-high school publishing business or the college textbook operation; other companies may want just Computer Curriculum.
Bantam Doubleday Dell, owned by Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant, has been widely speculated to be interested in buying into Simon & Schuster. Stuart Applebaum, a Bantam Doubleday spokesman, however, said yesterday that the company was not interested in the educational division but only in trade publishing, a unit not expected to be up for sale.
A top executive at Simon & Schuster said that all the decisions were being made out of Viacom and that they knew little about the parent company's plans. Meetings are scheduled today for the division's top executives with Simon & Schuster's chief executive, Jonathan Newcomb.
According to people involved with the sale, Viacom has not yet begun circulating the detailed financial data that buyers require to analyze a prospective acquisition. Still, Viacom is said to hope a deal will be completed by the second or third quarter of 1998.
In the 1996 fiscal year, Simon & Schuster accounted for $2.3 billion of the company's $12.1 billion in revenue and for $217 million of the $1.2 billion in operating income.
In contrast, the company's cable networks and broadcasting business generated roughly the same revenue, $2.4 billion, but $630 million in operating income -- or nearly three times that of the publishing business. Since 1994, the book business's profits have jumped only 12.7 percent, while the network and broadcasting business has seen a 95 percent surge in profits.
Viacom had considered spinning off some of its publishing assets, but in order to do a spinoff without generating large taxes, the company would have to to hold onto the assets for at least"," five years. That would have forced it to keep Simon & Schuster until 1999, clearly too long for Mr. Redstone.
''They're biting the bullet,'' said John Tinker an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ''But the real question now is how much they actually get and how fast they can actually pay off'' Viacom's $8 billion debt, he said.
The consumer book division, the Simon & Schuster operation that Viacom is said to be keeping, is a business that generally makes little money and operates at low margins. Still, the business offers Viacom the chance to cross-market books and films.
Not every media company, however, has been interested in such potential synergies. The Seagram Company, for example, which acquired both the publisher Putnam Berkley Group and Universal Studios when it acquired MCA, decided in 1996 to sell the publisher to Pearson P.L.C.'s Penguin Group for $336 million.",967,767,200,42.09071612358093,34.93174934387207,"[[0.9102464318275452, 0.5967345237731934, 0.7808718681335449, 0.849401593208313, 0.863854169845581, 0.5762829184532166, 0.8672209978103638, 0.9323128461837769, 0.9789644479751587, 0.8031695485115051, 0.9680010080337524, 0.9055400490760803, 0.8954446315765381, 0.9495916962623596, 0.8644530773162842, 0.9731671810150146, 0.9622174501419067, 0.8641555905342102, 0.8245409727096558, 0.579822301864624, 0.9466645121574402, 0.9201178550720215, 0.8778365254402161, 0.8919272422790527, 0.9185681343078613, 0.785362184047699, 0.8268649578094482, 0.6138119101524353, 0.8785333633422852, 0.638595700263977, 0.6280676126480103, 0.6865168213844299, 0.975968062877655, 0.9674246907234192, 0.8981678485870361, 0.8430265784263611, 0.8332898616790771, 0.9786341190338135, 0.8868001699447632, 0.9644450545310974, 0.887084424495697, 0.8992035388946533, 0.6852729916572571, 0.9030294418334961, 0.5992212295532227, 0.8272228240966797, 0.9768563508987427, 0.9814415574073792, 0.8019267916679382, 0.9175550937652588, 0.9314437508583069, 0.8408939838409424, 0.8915826678276062, 0.9828570485115051, 0.8987930417060852, 0.5711175799369812, 0.9765074849128723, 0.9677692651748657, 0.9551734924316406, 0.8852537870407104, 0.7841578125953674, 0.8745606541633606, 0.8513500094413757, 0.5684649348258972, 0.9209499955177307, 0.9541462659835815, 0.7357189655303955, 0.7762987017631531, 0.9815086722373962, 0.7604700922966003, 0.8738765120506287, 0.6377241611480713, 0.899326741695404, 0.8045883178710938, 0.9001756310462952]]"," five years.
Since Simon & Schuster's purchase of the publishing business, Viacom has not been able to sell its cable operations. After acquiring the television company, Viacom sold it to NBC Universal.
Even after an initial offer, Viacom was unable to find a buyer for the cable networks and television operations because it does not own enough stock to make a successful bid.
In the meantime, Viacom has been trying to sell the cable networks, which are dominated by CBS and ABC, under a new chief executive, David Zaslav.
Mr. Zaslav, the former chief executive of Time Warner, the media conglomerate, succeeded Sumner Redstone last summer as Viacom's chief executive.
Viacom has been trying to sell the cable networks for years, but found little interest from other cable companies. The company has been trying to sell the broadcast networks for years, but had no takers.

8636,"Zuke Chutoro, seared Bluefin tuna cured in Soy sauce at Kusakabe in San Francisco, Calif., is seen on Saturday, July 19th, 2014.
Sitting in Kusakabe at the light polished wood sushi counter, cut from a single tree, with a delicate glass pitcher of sake, a small hand towel in a black saucer and the fifth of 11 courses, the thought emerges: This style of refined dining could also be a boon for fixed-price Western restaurants.
The people who say they wouldn't go to the French Laundry, Benu or Saison because of the precious parade of courses, the formal atmosphere and the extended length of time at the table are some of the same people sitting at the sushi counter eating one bite of delicate sushi after another, as one hour slips into the next.
It's hard not to be captivated by the skill of chef-owner Mitsunori Kusakabe. There are no decisions to be made as diners sit back, relax and are taken on a culinary journey that costs $95 for 11 dishes, mostly sushi but with a soup course and another hot dish.
Dinner begins with a briny broth of kelp tea designed to decompress the 17 patrons at the sushi bar and the 12 who are seated at tables. The waiter also brings a damp black finger towel so diners can wipe their fingers after picking up the sushi with their hands - the way suggested by the waiter, who is as calming as the tea.
Kusakabe defines his menu as omakase sushi, kaiseki style, referring to two distinct types of dining. Kaiseki is a set menu, precisely designed and served. A true omakase menu is based on individual diners' preferences gleaned from their ongoing relationship with the chef. It's a menu built on trust.
Yet in a broader sense the term is accurate here because the chef creates the menu; it's somewhat standardized, but on each of my three visits he made adjustments. Every ingredient is sliced, chopped, drizzled and squeezed to order.
For the first course, the chef places a piece of bluefin tuna, dark from its soy sauce cure, on a small pad of rice. He briefly torches half the flesh to caramelize it, intensify the flavor and firm up the texture - an artful contrast in a single bite.
Next comes a piece of halibut sliced to order, with shallow slits in the flesh to help diffuse the flavorings. The chef adds a dab of its liver gently scooped from a tiny tin, places it on the center of the white flesh, dribbles on a soy-like sauce and tops it with delicate ribbons of shiso. Next up is bonito with a small mound of pickled daikon and rings of scallions.
The sashimi - slices of amber jack and halibut because I am allergic to the scallops that would normally be part of the mix - is arranged on a mound of what looks like snow cone ice accompanied by a soy dipping sauce and a chunky blend of yuzu and onions.
Miso soup offered a warm change of pace, an intense broth with two tender duck meatballs, mitsuba (Japanese parsley) and a hint of sansho peppers. On other visits the soup featured summer truffles floating among the ribbons of herbs, with eringi and shimeji mushrooms visible just below the surface. The flavors are at once strong and subtle.
Next comes what's labeled unique sushi, although everything that came before could be described the same way. In this case, ""unique"" meant Tasmanian trout cured in kombu on two squares of rice flavored with cilantro and sesame seed. It was finished with sesame miso to bring all the flavors together.
On subsequent visits, the chef served a rice flour cracker that resembled a small pottery bowl shaped like a flower. It's so shiny and well formed that the chef had to tell me to pick it up and eat the entire thing, because I had started to use chopsticks to pick up the rice and barbecued eel on top.
Next is the second warm dish, which was the same on all three visits - two finger-size pieces of crab on tofu, caked in crispy rice and garnished with a slice of key lime so thin it looked like parchment. The waiter then pours on Hokkaido kombu dashi broth. It's yet another example of the tension between bold, subtle, crisp, creamy, warm and cool - the dish touches all those notes. This type of juxtaposition describes many of Kusakabe's dishes.
The next two bites, labeled ""sushi chic,"" included striped bass with a sprinkling of sea salt, gratings of Meyer lemon peel and a few drops of juice. In between each course the chef wipes off the black lacquer rectangles on the shelf above the counter in front of each diner, and replenishes the small bowls of pickled ginger.
For her part, the server is always subtly looking over diners' shoulders, answering questions and helping them to decide what to order from 16 sakes, 16 wines or five beers.
The sake is available in a 3-ounce glass, 6-ounce carafe or by the bottle. Each round is served in different containers - crystal cubes, thick earthen pottery, translucent green cups and long-stemmed wineglasses for the more expensive Daiginjo ($15-$30 for a 3-ounce pour).
The meal continues to progress from lighter to heavier preparations. Next is what turns out to be the most intriguing dish of all - Copper River salmon with just a sprig of microgreens on top. I could have sworn there was a brush of maple syrup because it was so sweet, but we were simply tasting the natural essence of the fish. In just about every case, the fish is served at the perfect stage for sushi.
To finish, there's a choice: a slice of A5 Wagyu or toro - a lush, fatty piece of fish - on a pad of rice and topped with a small knob of wasabi.
That's the end of the tasting menu. From there, diners can order from 20 a la carte sushi or sashimi items or, if you have an appetite like mine, you might want to try the expertly prepared Santa Barbara sea urchin ($8.50 per piece), Hokkaido uni ($14) or barbecued white eel ($14). Then there's whiting cured with kombu and bonito"," flakes ($8.50), cherrywood-smoked bonito ($8.50) and five maki rolls, including one with braised Japanese squash ($7.50).
Desserts are also extra: mild green tea creme brulee ($6) and a refreshing yuzu and shiso ice ($4.50) topped with a green tea cookie in the shape of a K.
By the time you get to that point you feel as satisfied and refreshed as if you've had a relaxing massage and rest.
On my last visit, as I was paying the bill, the gracious waiter leaned over and whispered that if I let them know next time, they would do preparations differently from the printed menu. Finally I discovered what a true omakase menu might mean.
Dinner Tuesday-Sunday, 5 p.m to last seating at 8:30 p.m. Beer, wine and sake. Reservations and credit cards accepted.

Finally, there's the dessert menu with a huge assortment of rice cakes, soufflés and other sweets. The desserts are piled high, but the lightness of each one balances each other out.
At Kusakabe, most of the dishes are priced at about $15. For the sake and sake cocktails ($6-$8), the wine list ($40-$50), and the sake and sake cocktails ($30-$35), the dinner meal is a bargain.
The wine list, which includes a number of imported Japanese wines, is quite extensive with selections from New Zealand, France, Chile, Argentina, Germany, Italy and Spain. The sake list includes such Japanese brands as Nama, Shudo and Kamo.
The kitchen here is run by Masayuki Shishio, who was born and raised in"," (sea scallops).
It's clear Kusakabe is developing a reputation for his attention to detail. On three visits, for example, he was able to create a perfectly balanced tuna tartare for a friend who has a difficult time digesting salmon, which is often served raw. The sushi chef is able to create a balance between the sweet and salty flavors of the tuna because he has so much control over his ingredients - salmon is the star of the menu and is the food of choice here because Kusakabe can control the temperature and the salt of the water and fish.
Each course comes in a small, beautiful ceramic vessel with a clear plastic lid. It reminds me of a Japanese tea set but instead of tea, Stamina is the name of the drink of choice for each table. The sherry is just as refreshing, the sake even more so.
The server is always attentive to whether the server wants to use a chopstick, a chopstick holder or chopsticks to",200,200,0.2706101226806641,0.45174949765205386,"{'num_tokens_scored': 196, 'num_green_tokens': 159, 'green_fraction': 0.8112244897959183, 'z_score': 8.714285714285714, 'p_value': 1.4629879695751486e-18, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([1.0000, 1.4142, 1.7321, 2.0000, 2.2361, 2.4495, 2.6458, 2.8284, 2.3333,

8637,"BULLISH Alex McLeish is not expecting the chop when he meets Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner next week.
McLeish’s first season in charge has seen him narrowly avoid ­relegation and furious fans have called for his head.
With a record low four wins at home this season, McLeish has had to endure torrents of abuse from disgruntled supporters.
But he revealed that he will go into talks with"," the board outlining the kind of budget he thinks he needs to start turning the club around.
Big Eck said he hadn’t given any consideration to question marks over his future.
He said: “I haven’t ­given that any thought at all. Hopefully now we can move forward.
“I’ve been in charge one season. Did anyone expect me to win the league? Come on – I think people have to be more understanding.
“I anticipate being here next season. Yes, we have underachieved for a football club like Aston Villa.

But he insisted that he had no regrets about steering the team away from relegation battle.
He said: “I’m not going"," owner ­Lerner when the club's season comes to a close on Sunday.
The Scottish boss said: “I don't think we're at a point yet where there's anything to announce.
“I've had a great season and it's been a very enjoyable season, but it's difficult when you're losing games.
“It's disappointing for the supporters but it's a long way from our supporters being disappointed for me.
“I can't speak for them, I can only speak for myself, but the way I see it is I have got a great club, I've got great players.
“I've given a great season to them and if it hadn't have been for a lot of injuries we might have been able to compete for a spot in Europe.”
McLeish’s players are due to be announced today after he is able to take them to a training session in Spain.

5184,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - U.S. and Russian flight controllers worked to fully restore computers aboard the International Space Station on Thursday after a system crash that could force the $100 billion outpost’s crew back to Earth.
NASA said it did not regard the problem as critical and believed it was a long way from having to contemplate abandoning the space station, a 16-nation project.
But the U.S. space agency made plans to keep the visiting space shuttle Atlantis attached to the station for an extra day to help steer the massive complex if the Russian computers, which control navigation, continue to malfunction.
“We’re still struggling to understand what the real problem is here,” said NASA’s associate administrator for spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier.
Flight directors told the crew to cut power to noncritical equipment, like lighting, to conserve electricity and fuel in case the shuttle’s mission to the space station is extended.
In the worst-case scenario, the three astronauts aboard the station, including NASA’s newly arrived Clayton Anderson, could leave in the escape ship, a Russian Soyuz capsule.
As a precaution, the Soyuz was put on battery power on Wednesday for seven hours before one primary and one auxiliary computer system in the Russian modules were rebooted on Thursday, allowing the capsule to be returned to station power.
Two other primary systems, which control navigation and operate life support systems like an oxygen generator and air purifiers, remained shut down.
The station has backup systems for life support and the shuttle has been firing its control jets to help it maintain proper orbit.
“We won’t ask you how you’re doing because we can imagine,” a Russian flight director, speaking through a translator, said to station commander Fyodor Yurckikhin, who skipped a night’s sleep to work on the computer problems.
The computer glitches began shortly after a newly installed solar wing panel began producing power. Gerstenmaier said it would likely take days to find out why the computers were misbehaving.
Work continued on Thursday on the retraction of the second half of an older solar wing panel that must be moved before the new array can rotate and track the sun for full power.
Spacewalking astronauts Patrick Forrester and Steven Swanson helped guide the old wing into its storage"," box on Wednesday. Their crewmates James Reilly and John “Danny” Olivas are due to finish the job during a spacewalk on Friday.
Reilly and Olivas also are scheduled to repair a bit of protruding insulation near the rear of the shuttle. A corner of the blanket tore loose during Atlantis’ launch six days ago, potentially exposing inner layers of the shuttle’s surface to superheated gases on re-entry.

Napier shearer Ricci Stevens completed a unique double of doubles on Saturday night when he won a New Zealand Senior shearing title final, which would almost inevitably have its own special place in shearing sports history whomever won.
The 26-year-old had also on Thursday won the senior woolhandling title, having also previously won the junior titles in both aspects of the shearing sports – shearing in 2015 and woolhandling last year.
No other competitor has won New Zealand championships titles in both shearing and woolhandling.
The runner-up was King Country-based Catherine Mullooly, who as a junior on the same stage in 2014 became the first woman to be named top-ranked competitor in any grade of shearing and who last night was just 1.145pts from becoming the first female senior winner since the championships were first held as the King Country Shears in 1985.
Third place went to South Island-based Luis Pincol, from Chile, just 2.211pts from scoring the biggest-ever win by a shearer from South America.
The shape of the senior final changed dramatically when top-ranked Tegwyn Bradley, of Woodville, winner of 14 other finals during the season including the Golden Shears, was eliminated in the semifinals on Saturday afternoon.
Son-in-law of 2017 world champion and employer John Kirkpatrick, Stevens made his intentions clear",", more than 20 seconds clear of nearest challengers Mullooly and Pincol through the halfway stage and ultimately shearing the 12 sheep in 13min 58.38sec, half a minute clear of eventual second-man-off and Gore-based fourth placegetter Lionel Taumata, from Taumarunui.
Mullooly was third to finish, in 13min 31.28sec, and was by more than a point the best shearer in the board judging, but suffered in the judging in the pens afterwards.
The 2017 Intermediate champion, Masterton-based Sean Gouk, was fifth and sixth was Whakapunaki (Naki) Maraki, of Flaxmere, who on Thursday was fourth in the Junior woolhandling final won by partner Ngaira Puha.
Stevens has the choice of going up to open grade in both shearing and woolhandling next season, but is still just short of the threshold for upgrading.",526,326,200,34.421457290649414,70.74386715888977,"[[0.9100739359855652, 0.6124283075332642, 0.8211331963539124, 0.9186293482780457, 0.7015302777290344, 0.8880994915962219, 0.8062463998794556, 0.6185677647590637, 0.9135339856147766, 0.960027277469635, 0.957106351852417, 0.9812254309654236, 0.9868935346603394, 0.8889970183372498, 0.8792807459831238, 0.8873214721679688, 0.9552943110466003, 0.9032099843025208, 0.9819769859313965, 0.896760880947113, 0.6105425357818604, 0.9870911836624146, 0.6615765690803528, 0.9912293553352356, 0.9490601420402527, 0.8679032325744629, 0.9777070879936218, 0.8588458299636841, 0.9397422075271606, 0.8907009363174438, 0.7886607646942139, 0.6792935729026794, 0.5681347250938416, 0.9048464298248291, 0.8668345212936401, 0.8120251297950745, 0.8683317303657532, 0.8046336770057678, 0.6429893970489502, 0.8847019076347351, 0.6098204255104065, 0.9550220370292664, 0.9753519892692566, 0.8546561002731323, 0.8952351212501526, 0.9189308285713196, 0.9683095216751099, 0.5677762031555176, 0.7808833718299866, 0.579474687576294, 0.9931930899620056, 0.9983940720558167, 0.9605834484100342, 0.8998312950134277, 0.9825576543807983, 0.8731095194816589, 0.6996296644210815, 0.5683008432388306, 0.8992841243743896, 0.706745982170105, 0.9042067527770996, 0.6562001705169678, 0.8750082850456238, 0.8296393752098083, 0.9474831223487854, 0.9249526858329773, 0.8848789930343628, 0.8952045440673828, 0.9277592897415161, 0.9799091219902039, 0.9332471489906311, 0.8851691484451294, 0.6005361676216125, 0.9316222667694092, 0.9061509370803833, 0.6054224371910095, 0.9575478434562683, 0.914767861366272, 0.5687785148620605, 0.6784756183624268, 0.8988277912139893, 0.9813916087150574, 0.5703302621841431, 0.9635064005851746, 0.8677813410758972, 0.5687400698661804, 0.8735229969024658, 0.910824716091156, 0.787419319152832, 0.6862830519676208, 0.8505258560180664, 0.8629747033119202, 0.5980504751205444, 0.942503809928894, 0.6279592514038086, 0.9233047962188721, 0.6096301078796387, 0.794555127620697, 0.9704192280769348, 0.8987905383110046, 0.688543438911438, 0.9798130393028259, 0.9061263799667358, 0.9763104915618896, 0.8868542313575745, 0.9699632525444031, 0.6759529709815979, 0.9845733642578125, 0.957582414150238, 0.908212423324585, 0.6651721596717834, 0.9060840010643005, 0.9143483638763428, 0.6559000015258789, 0.6674821376800537, 0.7238553166389465, 0.8999197483062744, 0.9386970400810242, 0.7163621783256531, 0.5681048631668091, 0.846863865852356, 0.9545618891716003, 0.7456540465354919, 0.7214479446411133, 0.5909746885299683, 0.616646409034729, 0.7783446907997131, 0.7393274307250977, 0.6220958828926086, 0.951992392539978, 0.9641720652580261, 0.9746556878089905, 0.984061062335968, 0.8373003005981445, 0.9753736853599548, 0.6888612508773804, 0.7270856499671936, 0.8892201781272888, 0.6763200163841248, 0.968774139881134, 0.8725044131278992, 0.9052233099937439, 0.863865315914154, 0.8366664052009583, 0.9684799909591675, 0.9544985890388489, 0.8370388746261597, 0.9371729493141174, 0.8595439791679382, 0.8989019393920898, 0.8755120635032654, 0.9738763570785522, 0.703010618686676, 0.7484870553016663, 0.9553154110908508, 0.8389139771461487, 0.673540472984314, 0.8588119745254517, 0.8472685217857361, 0.7199955582618713, 0.7083962559700012, 0.7917733788490295, 0.8600532412528992, 0.607528805732727, 0.9523830413818359, 0.9580637216567993, 0.9413687586784363, 0.9767576456069946, 0.9193993806838989, 0.7165913581848145, 0.9703043103218079, 0.8614816665649414, 0.6292989253997803, 0.8470984697341919, 0.9010459184646606, 0.9269900918006897, 0.9756808876991272, 0.8653095364570618, 0.5894944071769714, 0.78517085313797, 0.9358519911766052, 0.8754903674125671, 0.9683009386062622, 0.9152369499206543, 0.7902882695198059, 0.9181398749351501, 0.8438742160797119, 0.9703940153121948, 0.6427941918373108, 0.5681178569793701, 0.8328222036361694, 0.6348329186439514, 0.9409809112548828, 0.9638727903366089, 0.9737961292266846, 0.9159945249557495, 0.8889879584312439, 0.902604877948761, 0.8976282477378845, 0.9882029891014099]]"," when he won the first final round at the Waikato Shears, scoring 10.764pts.
