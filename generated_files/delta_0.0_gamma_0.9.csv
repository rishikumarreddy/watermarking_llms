9793,"""As it becomes more difficult to defend Obama, the probability of a charge of racism approaches.""
""It is becoming well nigh impossible to deny the racist overtones of these protests.""
What, may you ask, is the strongest argument for this astounding claim?
""Many of the virtually all-white crowd on Saturday yearned for an earlier time with less government involvement in society.""
You read that correctly: the fact that this crowd was predominantly caucasian (by Winters&apos; account), proves that it must be racist. By Winters&apos; logic, the United States Senate must be ""racist"" - it is ""virtually all-white"", after all.
""But, that earlier time [of less government involvement in society] recalls, for many of us, the memory of states’ rights being enforced through dogs and water cannons.""
3)... the anti-tax marchers want a return to racial segregation.
That is Winters&apos; argument, in three easy steps.
Liberal Catholics will go ballistic when a conservative Catholic writer makes an absurd argument, and demand that fellow conservatives disown the maverick&apos;s argument. Because, on the whole, we strive to be reasonable and agreeable people, we typically do so. We can call one of our own out of bounds without feeling we&apos;ve eroded our common arguments. We can call crazy ""crazy"" because we try to avoid it. Winters seems to be reduced to just writing crazy.
Well, in similar fashion",", I&apos;d like to see some ""liberal"" Catholic writers take Winters to the woodshed for this one. People who don&apos;t like Obama don&apos;t like him because they are racist - really?! Is anyone typically sympathetic to Winters prepared to defend this claim of his? There are many more people in America who did not attend this march who are sympathetic to the concerns of those who did attend. Are all of them equally guilty of the racism Winters ascribes?
I&apos;ll be waiting for such logical reflection on these claims Winters has injected into the debate.
But frankly, until Winters himself retracts this stupidity, I&apos;ll feel free to disregard him completely.
After all, I shouldn&apos;t give my time to someone who writes for a racist magazine like America.

It is enough to make you want to open a nice bottle of wine and join in the singing of ""God Bless America"" - the kind of song that Winters uses to convince the American public that he is not crazy. Or the kind of song that Winters sang to his mother, who used to sing it to him as a child.
4)... the anti-tax marchers want to return to racial segregation.
The anti-tax marchers want to return to racial segregation.
""Although the anti-tax marchers marched on Washington, they wanted to do more than enforce federal law. They wanted to return to a time when racial segregation was the norm and when blacks were treated as second-class citizens. They wanted to try to restore the Jim Crow era.""
When we think of Jim Crow, we tend",", it is easy to see how many conservatives can be misled by Winters&apos; argument. The writer allows no room for the possibility that the anti-tax marchers want a return to racial segregation, or that the marchers want a return to the era of Jim Crow. To some extent, he does concede this point by claiming that the marchers want a less-government society. ""We are working to reduce the role of government,"" he writes, and indeed they have worked toward that goal. But he then devotes a full page to the claim:
""We are not pro-government. We are pro-socialism.""
Even though the argument is a pre-emptive attack on his ideological opponents, it is still preposterous. Socialists, of course, are not pro-government. That is one of Winters&apos; favorite rhetorical devices.
The assertion that the anti-tax marchers want a return to racial segregation is not only",200,200,0.12557080864906311,0.2941584086418152,"{'num_tokens_scored': 175, 'num_green_tokens': 162, 'green_fraction': 0.9257142857142857, 'z_score': 1.1338934190276817, 'p_value': 0.12841962897892828, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([0.3333, 0.4714, 0.5774, 0.6667, 0.7454, 0.8165, 0.8819, 0.9428, 1.0000,

3801,"With so many hoops to jump through to close transactions, falling home prices, and unrealistic sellers and buyers, today’s agents have to hustle harder than ever before. This doesn’t have to be the case. With the right systems and the right processes in place, you can work smarter rather than hustling harder.
Everyone has systems. The question is: Which systems support your business to thrive vs. which systems create a drag on your production? A system can be as simple as taking a different route to work each day to search for for-sale-by-owner homes, or as complex as doing all your business online.
The hallmarks of a strong system are that it is repeatable, it reduces time and effort, and it yields consistent results. If you’re interested in working smarter rather than hustling harder, here are five areas where you can begin to systematize your business.
If you’re like most agents, you have multiple phone numbers on your business card. It’s much easier for clients to contact you on a single phone number. One of the simplest solutions is to use Google Voice. Google Voice provides you with a single phone number that goes to every one of your phones in the order you specify.
Your clients can find you easily, no matter where you are. Google Voice also allows you to keep your cell phone and your home phone private. When you are in a situation where you cannot take a voice call, Google Voice can transcribe your message into an email or text message. Surprisingly, there is no charge for this service, and it works both in the U.S. and Canada.
An increasing number of companies and agents are electing to go paperless. Many associations already publish their various contracts in a digital format. You can download these forms to any type of computer. They may also be available in the ""cloud,"" using systems such as DocuSign. Digital signatures can be obtained either through the equivalent of a lock-and-key approach (think of your credit card number tied to a password) or with an actual digital signature. On the tablet PCs, your clients sign their documents with a light pen. On the iPad, they can sign using their finger with apps such as Zosh.
Another way to go paperless is to create a digital pre-list package. In addition to the various forms and documents required to close a transaction, you can include a sample 90-day marketing plan, a digital brochure of the seller’s property, plus a link to the single-property website that you create for your sellers. Going paperless is one of the most effective ways to save both time and gasoline costs.
Many agents struggle with the idea of starting and maintaining a blog. There’s a simple solution, and it’s right in the outbox of your email. If you’re like most agents, you haven’t cleaned your outbox recently. If this is the case, look back through your past emails. Every email where you answered a client question is a potential blog post.
A simple way to create great content for your blog is to answer client questions using your blog rather than your email. Post both the question and the answer in your blog. You can also post market updates plus upcoming neighborhood events.
If you enjoy taking photos or videos, post them on your blog or your Facebook business page. Since most blogging platforms allow you to schedule your posts at a later date, increase the effectiveness of your system by doing all of your posts at the same time each week. Plug in the time and date you want the post published and the blogging platform handles it automatically.
Your interactions on social media are another great area to systematize. For example, if you have 150 Facebook friends, take 10 minutes each day to either ""like"" or comment on something that five of your friends post. At the end of the month, you will have contacted all 150 of your friends at least once.
Another approach is to use a system such as HootSuite. When you come across an article, picture, blog post, or some other online material that you believe your friends or followers may like, you can click the ""Tweet this"" button and HootSuite automatically creates a Tweet and posts to Facebook as well.
You can send the Tweet as is or modify it. The process takes just a few seconds and allows you to provide your followers with great information with a minimal amount of effort.","
How much time do you spend entering notes you have taken at listing appointments, inspections or walkthroughs on your computer? The paid version of Evernote allows you to take notes on your smartphone, iPad or personal computer. Evernote then makes those notes available on all of your Evernote-enabled devices simultaneously.
Instead of wasting time transferring this information from a handwritten form into a digital format, Evernote eliminates having to enter data twice saving you tremendous amounts of time and effort.
Which systems are best for you? The real test is in finding a system and then developing the habit of working with it regularly. The more you work with a system, the more efficient your use of the system becomes.
If the increasingly fast pace of the real estate business is draining your energy, a systems approach may be exactly what you need to put you back in control.

1713,"The value of Saudi industrial exports reached SR162 billion by the end of 2012 compared to SR110 million in 1974, Director General of Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) Ali Al-Ayed said.
Addressing a GCC industrial event in Oman, Al-Ayed said Saudi industrial exports have achieved high growth rates averaging 20 percent per year in the period 1974-2012.
It was organized by the Omani Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) in coordination with the Riyadh-based GCC general secretariat.
The SIDF chief attributed the robust growth of the industrial exports to the availability of hydrocarbons at preferential prices in addition to the conclusion of international and regional trade agreements to this end.
Plastic and chemical products accounted for 77"," percent of the total industrial exports in that year, followed by food products at 8 percent, base metals (6 percent), and electric devices and equipment (2 percent), he told the conference.
He said the SIDF used to adopt a series of measures to boost industrial exports, including attraction of foreign investments which had an effective role in transferring experience and technical know-how.

9232,"Although the case has not advanced to the point where he’s assigned it to prosecutors, Campbell said there was a good chance Cappleman, who is one of four top prosecutors in his office, could have been involved.
But Campbell said the conflict wouldn’t prevent other prosecutors at the office from prosecuting Latvala.
“There’s no conflict,” Campbell said.
Latvala, 66, was at the pinnacle of his power as Senate budget chairman until allegations of sexual harassment, first reported by Politico, surfaced in November.
The Senate initiated two investigations, including hiring retired Judge Ronald Swanson to serve as special master. On Dec. 19, Swanson found probable cause that Latvala had violated Senate misconduct rules and sexually harassed a legislative aide. Swanson also said that Latvala may have violated state corruption laws by seeking sexual intimacy with a lobbyist in exchange for legislative favors.
Investigators, led by the head of FDLE’s executive investigations team, Scott McInerney, have still not reached out to key players, including Latvala and the lobbyist, Laura McLeod, lawyers for both said Tuesday.
Around the time the harassment"," allegations surfaced, Latvala hired Chaires, a former Leon County sheriff’s deputy, according to Latvala’s attorney, Steven R. Andrews.
Chaires, who owns Warrior Security Contractors, did not turn up any listening devices, he said.
Andrews noted that the work was completed before any potential criminal charges had emerged. Chaires was paid the $645 — not even a full day’s work for a typical investigator — on Dec. 11, nine days before Latvala resigned.
Andrews said he was not aware that Chaires was married to the deputy assistant state attorney.
Criminal defense lawyers told the Times/Herald that Campbell did the right thing in removing Cappleman, who is also a candidate for judge, from a potential Latvala case. Although Latvala’s attorneys could try to move the case to another state attorney’s jurisdiction, it’s unlikely to be successful.",443,243,200,23.19116187095642,58.20628046989441,"[[1.000011682510376, 1.0000125169754028, 1.0000131130218506, 1.0000128746032715, 1.000000238418579, 1.000000238418579, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000115633010864, 1.000009298324585, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000059604644775, 1.0000032186508179, 1.0000131130218506, 1.0000075101852417, 1.000002384185791, 1.0000089406967163, 1.0000168085098267, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000079870224, 1.0000149011611938, 1.0000115633010864, 1.0000131130218506, 1.0000102519989014, 1.000001072883606, 1.0000014305114746, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000132322311401, 1.0000042915344238, 1.0000004768371582, 1.0000005960464478, 1.0000163316726685, 1.0, 1.0000015497207642, 1.0000065565109253, 1.000014305114746, 1.0000083446502686, 1.0000014305114746, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000131130218506, 1.0000042915344238, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000125169754028, 1.0000078678131104, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000171661376953, 1.000016450881958, 1.0000014305114746, 1.0000121593475342, 1.0000004768371582, 1.0000064373016357, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000102519989014, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000141859054565, 1.000001311302185, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000157356262207, 1.0, 1.0000025033950806, 1.0000061988830566, 1.0000077486038208, 1.0000075101852417, 1.0000065565109253, 1.0000022649765015, 1.0000174045562744, 1.0000039339065552, 1.000016450881958, 1.0000090599060059, 1.0000030994415283, 1.0000108480453491, 1.0000046491622925, 1.0000137090682983, 1.000013828277588, 1.000008225440979, 1.0000132322311401, 1.0000165700912476, 1.0000146627426147, 1.0000072717666626, 1.0000154972076416, 1.000009298324585, 1.000015377998352, 1.0000113248825073, 1.0000145435333252, 1.0000121593475342, 1.0000001192092896, 1.000006079673767, 1.0000020265579224, 1.0000009536743164, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000035762786865, 0.9999996423721313, 1.0000027418136597, 0.9999995231628418, 1.0000076293945312, 1.0000066757202148, 1.000009298324585, 1.0000094175338745, 1.0000090599060059, 1.0000001192092896, 1.000011920928955, 1.0000100135803223, 1.000015377998352, 1.0000029802322388, 1.0000125169754028, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000070333480835, 1.0000046491622925, 1.0000144243240356, 1.0000001192092896, 1.0000008344650269, 1.0000141859054565, 1.0000163316726685, 1.0, 1.0000016689300537, 1.0000005960464478, 1.0000008344650269, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000110864639282, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000110864639282, 1.0000107288360596, 1.0000121593475342, 1.0000025033950806, 1.0000044107437134, 1.0000190734863281, 1.0000107288360596, 1.000014305114746, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000004768371582, 1.0000063180923462, 1.0000014305114746, 1.0000168085098267, 1.0000028610229492, 1.0000098943710327, 1.0000128746032715, 1.0000104904174805, 1.000002384185791, 1.0000118017196655, 1.000012755393982, 1.0000081062316895, 1.000017762184143, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000051259994507, 1.0000025033950806, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000015497207642, 1.000005841255188, 1.000010371208191, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000101327896118, 1.000001311302185, 1.0000087022781372, 1.0000176429748535, 1.0000070333480835, 1.000011920928955, 1.000000238418579, 1.0000190734863281, 1.0000077486038208, 1.0000202655792236, 1.0000098943710327, 1.0000096559524536, 1.000011682510376, 1.0000016689300537, 1.0000011920928955, 1.0000135898590088, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000132322311401, 1.000011920928955, 1.0000009536743164, 1.0000048875808716, 1.0000205039978027, 1.000014066696167, 1.0000064373016357, 1.0000128746032715, 1.0000035762786865, 1.0000004768371582, 1.000002384185791, 1.0000033378601074, 1.0000026226043701, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000027418136597, 1.000001072883606, 1.0000067949295044, 1.0000056028366089, 1.0000016689300537, 1.0000191926956177, 1.0000165700912476, 1.0000125169754028, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000041723251343, 1.0000004768371582, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000090599060059, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000132322311401, 1.0000169277191162, 1.000008225440979, 1.0000011920928955, 1.0000020265579224]]"," allegations surfaced, Latvala was tapped to head the state Department of Transportation, which oversees state bridges and roads.
The Senate on Tuesday voted to bring up a bill that would require Latvala to step down from both positions and pay back $40,000 in state salary and $30,000 in campaign money to the Senate.
But Latvala’s supporters said that bill went too far, and would likely face legal challenges.
“The fact that we’re going to put this issue to a vote is a very bad sign,” said Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Tallahassee.
Senate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, called the bill a “bad idea” and said that the Senate would be better off if Latvala stepped aside.
“I think we’ve had enough of this issue,” Galvano said.
But Senate Democrats said they wanted"," allegations surfaced, Latvala also faced scrutiny for his handling of state budget bills. He has denied any wrongdoing.
On Tuesday, Latvala’s office said the lobbyist and McLeod had been contacted by investigators.
“We are disappointed in the FDLE’s lack of follow-up to see if this is a credible allegation and if so, if they have information about it,” Latvala spokeswoman Denise Renee said in a statement. “There is no pending case against Mr. Latvala.”
The FDLE declined to comment on the status of the case.
In the past, the agency has taken months to investigate serious allegations, including convictions, against its own employees. The investigation into Cappleman took just a few days, but it cost the agency $80,000 — an expense that was only reimbursed after the department sued the senator over it.

1387,"Premera Blue Cross Cyberattack Exposed Millions Of Customer Records : All Tech Considered The health insurance provider has revealed that a cyberattack discovered in January may have made the medical and financial information of 11 million people vulnerable to thieves.
Another big health insurance company has revealed it has been the target of a massive cyberattack.
Premera Blue Cross says hackers may have taken up to 11 million customer records. Those records include credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, even information about medical problems. This news is just coming out but Premera issued a statement saying it discovered the breach on Jan. 29. That's about the same date that Anthem, another Blue Cross company, told the FBI that it was breached.
It's possible that Anthem put the word out and, given the timelines, the attacks were related — done by the same perpetrator. At least that's an educated guess from the cybersecurity company iSight Partners.
Premera also says the attack itself started in May of last year. But iSight found a suspicious domain called ""prennera.com,"" an address that may have been made to spoof Premera's official website. It was created in December 2013.
Either way, that's many, many months to steal people's data. NPR has reported previously on the black market for credit cards and health records. Will a bunch of for-sale signs go up there? Probably not this time — or at least that's according to sources who hang out in the underground.
Health care data can be more valuable than credit card information on the black market. But so far, sources say, the Anthem data hasn't shown up on the underground sites. And Premera may not either. It could be that the hackers are not run-of-the-mill criminals, but in it for cyber-espionage.
Yes, cyber-espionage. As in spies. It's possible that a nation-state actor is involved.
Both health care companies are huge providers with lots of government workers. So if someone wants intel on Defense Department employees — where they live, spouses' names, serious (or embarrassing) medical conditions, a breach is a way to stockpile that data and use it for blackmail later.
As iSight malware analyst Brian Bartholomew says: ""The sole purpose of espionage is to steal information, gain advantage. By publicizing, you're giving up the leverage you have.""
NPR has asked Premera and the FBI whether they are alerting other health care providers to watch out or providing details other companies might benefit from. Neither has immediately responded to our inquiry.
There's another group called the National Healthcare ISAC (Information-sharing"," and Analysis Center) that helps to share breach information. They say they've been in contact with private investigators at Mandiant as well as federal investigators handling the case. So far, the specific ways that Premera was attacked — like the IP addresses the attacks came from or the specific types of malware — have not been declassified and shared with other potential targets.
Director Deborah Kobza says in an email, ""It is only through coordinated sector and cross-sector cybersecurity information sharing, that we, as a nation, can move critical infrastructure cybersecurity protection from a reactive to proactive stance.""
But what is Premera doing to protect victims — the up to 11 million people who may be affected here? Premera says it is offering two years of free credit monitoring.

The National Healthcare ISAC is a nonprofit organization created by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. It's a good idea to check it out. The FBI is also part of it.
As for Anthem — yes, it's a big company, but so is Premera. So it's not totally out of the question that Anthem was the target of a targeted attack.

3190,"China's central bank says fighting inflation will receive higher priority this year, raising the possibility of more rate hikes at a time when other major economies are trying to boost growth.
The announcement late Thursday follows repeated pledges by Beijing to cool inflation that jumped to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November. Communist leaders worry that sharp rises in living costs might trigger unrest.
""Stabilizing price levels will receive more prominent status,"" the People's Bank of China said in a report after an annual planning meeting. The bank said it will ""effectively manage liquidity and control financial conditions that might cause excessive price increases.""
Chinese stocks declined in early trading Friday after the announcement but the main index rebounded to positive territory by late morning.
The inflation surge highlights the contrast between China, which rebounded quickly from the global crisis and is trying to restore normal financial conditions, and the United States and struggling European economies.
Higher interest rates could further slow China's growth, possibly cutting its demand for factory machinery, industrial components, iron ore and other imports from the United States, Europe, Australia and its Asian neighbors.
China's rapid expansion slowed to"," 9.6 percent in the three months ending in September, down from 10.3 percent the previous quarter, though still the highest of any major economy. Analysts expect that to slow further this year as Beijing clamps down on credit and steers growth to a more sustainable level.
Analysts blame the price rises on the flood of bank lending that helped China ward off the global downturn. Inflation so far is limited mostly to food, but analysts say price pressures will spread unless Beijing raises interest rates further and tightens access to credit.
Inflation has been well above the government's target of 3 percent since late last year and some analysts expect it to rise further in December and January.
The central bank has raised interest rates twice in the past three months, most recently on Christmas Day. Many analysts expect more increases this year.

It's unclear how such a scenario would play out in China, where consumer prices are highly volatile and inflation has been subdued.
In November, China's price rises were driven by higher food costs, including meat and vegetables, and by higher housing costs. The central bank said in its report that Chinese households will likely continue to spend more on such items.
The central bank said it will ""effectively manage liquidity and control financial conditions that might cause excessive price increases.""
That suggests the central bank could raise its benchmark lending rate, which has been steady since April, in the first quarter but not in February, when most economists expect the benchmark rate to be raised.
That would provide some relief for a credit market that is under pressure from tighter controls.
The People's Bank said it will ""effectively manage liquidity and control financial conditions that"," a crawl in the last quarter of 2018. Consumer spending, the main driver of that growth, grew 5.1 percent in 2018, the weakest annual expansion since 1990.
Tin Pan, a senior economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong, said the central bank ""still has room to maneuver.""
""The central bank will continue to monitor inflation and will not rush to raise rates,"" Pan said.
Beijing is trying to revive growth by promoting private investment, state-backed construction circling the countryside and other measures. It's also running stimulus programs including a cash-for-clunkers campaign to buy less fuel-efficient vehicles and a tax cut for home buyers.
Analysts say reforms to reduce debt and provide more access to credit for small and mid-sized firms could boost China's growth to around 6 percent next year.
The central bank also said it will boost its lending to small and mid-sized companies. It said it will ""establish a mechanism to provide long-term",200,200,0.11513465404510498,0.29217461466789246,"{'num_tokens_scored': 195, 'num_green_tokens': 176, 'green_fraction': 0.9025641025641026, 'z_score': 0.11935247900657216, 'p_value': 0.45249805417816097, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 0.3333,  0.4714,  0.5774,  0.6667,  0.7454, -0.5443, -0.3780, -0.2357,

5360,"JUST a month after coming into power, the Zifa board have been rocked by a tsunami with vice-president Gift Banda being suspended yesterday following a meeting of the game's leaders held in the capital.
The Bulawayo-based football administrator, who was a runaway winner in the battle for the Zifa vice-presidency, was suspended for allegedly reshuffling the Warriors technical team without the blessing of his boss, Felton Kamambo, and other board members.
Banda, who was Zifa acting president when he announced that Rahman Gumbo and Lloyd Mutasa had been relieved of their duties and replaced by Bongani Mafu and Tonderai Ndiraya, was said to have acted beyond the jurisdiction of his authority.
In arguments presented to his fellow board members yesterday, Banda said he felt his role as the acting president empowered him to make such decisions.
He even suggested that if what he did was out of line with the constitution, then the board had the power to reverse the appointments and stick with the old Warriors technical set-up.
Kamambo was out of the country in Senegal for the Caf awards at the time.
The appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu had to be ratified at the Zifa board meeting which was held yesterday but things quickly took a nasty turn when Banda was asked to leave the room while other board members discussed the issue. While the board could have merely chosen not to ratify the appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu, if they felt they had not been done according to their constitution, they decided that punitive measures should be meted on the Zifa vice-president.
The matter was taken to a vote and four of the seven remaining members voted for Banda to be suspended, pending the confirmation of his suspension by the Zifa Council at the association's annual meeting in March, while three voted for him to be retained as the vice-president.
Ironically, Banda, who received 35 votes from Councillors in a strong showing in his successful battle to become the Zifa vice-president just a month ago, had"," his fate sealed by just four votes from his fellow board members.
Interestingly, a margin of one vote was all that mattered for him to be suspended from his post and he becomes the first Zifa vice-president to meet such a fate since Kenny Marange was also kicked out of the board by the leadership of Cuthbert Dube eight years ago.
It's the first time that a Zifa vice-president, the second most powerful man in the management of the game in the country, has been booted out after just one month.
Zifa boss Kamambo had, interestingly, told the domestic football family that his leadership will not suspend any of the board members because he felt such a system crippled the operations of the leadership of the game. However, things changed dramatically yesterday when Banda was shown the red card by his fellow board members just one month after coming into office.
Banda refused to comment on the developments yesterday saying he will release a comprehensive response in due course.",633,433,200,25.28250527381897,60.378767013549805,"[[1.0000035762786865, 1.0000030994415283, 1.0000011920928955, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000169277191162, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000050067901611, 1.0000139474868774, 1.0000104904174805, 1.0000126361846924, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000165700912476, 1.00001859664917, 1.0000101327896118, 1.000017523765564, 1.000007152557373, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000126361846924, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000056028366089, 1.000004768371582, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000163316726685, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000014305114746, 1.0000171661376953, 1.0000030994415283, 1.0000112056732178, 1.0000176429748535, 1.0000094175338745, 1.0000189542770386, 1.0000110864639282, 1.0000030994415283, 1.0000182390213013, 1.0000016689300537, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000025033950806, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000122785568237, 1.000020146369934, 1.0000029802322388, 1.0000189542770386, 1.0000044107437134, 1.0000125169754028, 1.000002145767212, 1.0000057220458984, 1.0000025033950806, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000176429748535, 1.0000044107437134, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000158548355103, 1.0000187158584595, 1.0000100135803223, 1.0000194311141968, 1.0000008344650269, 1.0000025033950806, 1.0000159740447998, 1.000001072883606, 1.0000063180923462, 1.0000029802322388, 1.0000028610229492, 1.0000195503234863, 1.0000033378601074, 1.0000022649765015, 1.0000108480453491, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000171661376953, 1.0000200271606445, 1.000001311302185, 1.0000089406967163, 1.000014305114746, 1.0000163316726685, 1.0000172853469849, 1.000017762184143, 1.0000046491622925, 1.0000029802322388, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000168085098267, 1.000009536743164, 1.000015139579773, 1.00001859664917, 1.0000189542770386, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000158548355103, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000120401382446, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000028610229492, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000184774398804, 1.0000107288360596, 1.0000182390213013, 1.0000107288360596, 1.0000035762786865, 1.0000073909759521, 1.000011682510376, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000183582305908, 1.0000184774398804, 1.0000108480453491, 1.0000061988830566, 1.0000126361846924, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000189542770386, 1.0000102519989014, 1.000011920928955, 1.000016689300537, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000149011611938, 1.000010371208191, 1.0000158548355103, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000135898590088, 1.0000033378601074, 1.0000078678131104, 1.0000067949295044, 1.0000267028808594, 1.0000145435333252, 1.0000038146972656, 1.0000020265579224, 1.0000190734863281, 1.000000238418579, 1.0000040531158447, 1.0000033378601074, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000144243240356, 1.00001859664917, 1.0000097751617432, 1.0000158548355103, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000118017196655, 1.0000087022781372, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000134706497192, 1.0000182390213013, 1.0000123977661133, 1.000012993812561, 1.0000096559524536, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000180006027222, 1.000009536743164, 1.000013828277588, 1.0000005960464478, 1.0000052452087402, 1.0000039339065552, 1.0000135898590088, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000202655792236, 1.000009536743164, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000046491622925, 1.000004529953003, 1.0000053644180298, 1.0000015497207642, 1.000013828277588, 1.0000015497207642, 1.000009536743164, 1.0000064373016357, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000059604644775, 1.0000011920928955, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000001192092896, 1.000011920928955, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000087022781372, 1.0000089406967163, 1.0000050067901611, 1.000001311302185, 1.0000001192092896, 1.0000195503234863, 1.0000008344650269, 1.000025987625122, 1.0000237226486206, 1.0000114440917969, 1.0000022649765015, 1.0000009536743164, 1.0000169277191162, 0.9999995827674866, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000070333480835, 1.00001060962677, 1.0000144243240356, 1.0000014305114746, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000016689300537, 1.0000044107437134, 1.0000149011611938, 1.000017762184143, 1.0000046491622925]]"," earlier told the board that he had respect for their decision.
""I respect the decision of the board as they are the ones that have proposed the appointment Griffin Mutasa as the new Warriors coach.
""I respect their decision and I will continue to meet them (board members) to discuss the matter,"" said Banda.
It was not clear from the proceedings what the reason for Banda's suspension was, but the Zifa board has since been in talks over his fate.
The Zifa board have also been in the midst of a power struggle with Kamambo and other board members demanding that they get a new president.
It was the first time that Banda has been suspended by the Zifa board.
His suspension comes a day after Kamambo, the acting president, was suspended for two weeks by the Zifa board, with the decision taken as a result of his refusal to honour a board meeting scheduled to be held yesterday.
The meeting was to ratify the"," his suspension upheld by the Zifa Council last year when he challenged it through the courts.
Banda, who was suspended for six months, claimed that the suspension was illegal and he took the matter to the court. He was granted a two-month stay of execution in February.
""The board has found out that Banda acted beyond his authority and has therefore suspended him pending a full hearing and determination of the matter.
""He has been suspended with immediate effect pending the full hearing and determination of the matter by the Zifa Council at the association's annual meeting in March,"" said Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa.
Chiyangwa added: ""The board will meet at a later date to deliberate on the matter.""

1180,"TLC member says she'll stream Supernova on Web site to meet self-imposed deadline.
To quote Sunshine Anderson, we've ""heard it all before.""
After years of talk and no delivery, nobody should be surprised that Arista has announced it will push back the in-store date for Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes' solo debut, Supernova, from summer to fall.
However, the self-proclaimed ""crazy"" of TLC said she'll have her music out to the people on August 16 by hook or by crook.
""I picked the 16th as the release date because something weird happened in my family,"" she explained. ""My father died and his father was born on August 16. And January 31 was the day that he was born and his father died. So they came in and out on each other's dates, and they were both 40 when they died.""
Left Eye is so adamant about the album coming out next week that she said she'll stream the album's 13 tracks on her Web site (www.eyenetics.com) starting at 12:01 a.m. on that fateful day. She's getting support from the label online; an Arista spokesperson said the tracks will also be streamed on parent company BMG's click2music.com.
""It's a very significant release date for me,"" Left Eye said. ""It was something that has been sitting in the back of my mind for a couple of years now like, 'Wow, I wonder what that means?' There's magic in those numbers for me, because 162001 equals 10, which in numerology is symbolic of a star, and the album is called Supernova. It all ties in. It's a conceptual thing but there's a deep meaning buried in it. Everything has a double meaning.""
A fair share of stars guest on the album. Look for appearances by Carl Thomas, Esthero, Blaque and Tupac Shakur.
""The track with Tupac is titled 'Untouchable,' and it speaks for itself,"" Left Eye said. ""Tupac and everything about him is untouchable to me. I didn't record the song with him. I got a copy of the song and his lyrics were on the track. If you want to talk about whether I recorded it before or after his death, I can't answer that. It's still a mystery to me.""
Left Eye said she asks about the mysteries of life, and the mysteries of Pac's life, on the track.
""I'm basically asking him to answer those questions for me,"" she said. ""In the third verse he gives me his view from the other side. Some of the song's lyrics are so heavy. He says things like, 'You remember me legendary, I live eternally.' He produced the song. It's dynamite to me because he isn't"," known as a producer. It's like a double whammy because I get a song produced by Tupac  a song featuring him that actually features me. I'm featured on a Tupac song on my album.""
As to why Arista has decided to push back the album's release after confirming it would be out on August 14 a month ago (see ""Left Eye Delivering Solo Supernova... Finally""), a label spokesperson said Arista wanted Left Eye to record more tracks for the album as well as lay vocals for the new TLC disc.

A robot based on the patent for an Xbox controller, though one that can play games, was recently unveiled by Microsoft.
The gamepad that developers call ""The Controller"" is controlled by the Kinect. That's a fancy way of saying that it can physically detect the position of your head and give you an idea of where it is relative to the camera.
The controller has been designed to work with Microsoft's Xbox 360 console, which supports two controllers at a time.

2417,"In a 53-page document filed quietly last week with environmental regulators and made public Tuesday, sweeping changes are detailed in the state’s highway tolling infrastructure and policies – including a program to charge tolls on the Tobin Bridge for northbound and southbound traffic.
The document – published in the insider-only ‘Environmental Monitor’ – details the new All-Electronic Tolling System (AETS) implementation project, a project addressed in some measure through meetings held in Chelsea and other municipalities earlier this summer. It’s a project Gov. Deval Patrick has pushed since day one, eliminating cash toll collection booths and going to an all-electronic system. It would be the largest toll road electronic conversion project in the nation to date, if approved.
While the document made public this week is concerned mostly with environmental aspects of the project, many key details in the tolling plan emerged concerning the Tobin Bridge and harbor tunnels (Ted Williams, Callahan, Sumner and I-90 Boston Extension).
One of the major changes for the Tobin and harbor tunnels includes adding tolling locations for northbound traffic. Currently, all northbound traffic out of Boston on the Bridge and tunnels pays no toll. Under the new plan, AETS gateways would be added for northbound and southbound traffic – meaning that a person going into Boston from Chelsea or other points north would be charged going in and coming out.
There was no word in the document about whether Chelsea’s host community discount would continue for the Bridge, which would be a key question for those living in Chelsea. That said, state transportation officials have certainly had their sights set on eliminating such discounts systemwide for the last several years. That, however, will be a conversation for a different day and likely something that local leaders will have to fight for.
The toll booths on the Tobin would be demolished under the plan, and new AETS gateways would be stretched over the southbound roadway after the Bridge and just before the exit splits (Rutherford Ave. or 93 South) in Charlestown.
Later, a northbound tolling gateway is proposed to stretch across the northbound roadway just prior to the entrance to the Bridge tunnel, also in Charlestown.
The southbound Tobin AETS gateway would actually end up being the Pilot Program for the new technology – being implemented next year as a test for the systemwide change that is proposed for 2015.
The system would work via the EZ Pass electronic collection method that many already use. Statistics in the filing showed that 68 percent of tolls at the Bridge and harbor tunnels in 2012 were collected via the EZ Pass. For those who do not or cannot convert to the EZ Pass system, photos of a person’s license plate will be taken at each toll gateway and an invoice will be sent on a monthly basis to the owner of that plate. The state has already worked out a system of enforcement with other states to collect unpaid tolls from out-of-state placeholders. Similarly, those in-state placeholders who do not pay the invoices would be subject to fines and Registry withholdings.
For those in Chelsea who use the Ted Williams Tunnel or the Callahan Tunnel, there would be a major change and with no possible savings via the host discount. The northbound Callahan Tunnel and the northbound side of the Ted Williams Tunnel also will begin charging a toll – a movement that is now free as tolls are only charged for those coming into Boston.
“The Metropolitan Highway System (MHS) Williams Tunnel currently collects tolls in two nearby westbound (inbound) plazas by Logan Airport,” read the filing. “These structures will be retained, but cash collection booths and equipment will be removed. Also, this tunnel will be converted from one-way to two-way tolling, with the addition of an AETS toll zone for eastbound traffic. Rates will be modified to reflect the change in tolls by collection in both directions.
While the filing indicated modified rates for only the Williams Tunnel due to two-way tolling, it did not specify what kind of rate modification, and it mentioned no rate modifications for two-way tolling at the Tobin Bridge and Sumner/Callahan crossings.
All in"," all, 18 new gated toll locations would be added to the system to accompany the existing 24 locations.
While most of the locations are in Western and Central Massachusetts on the Mass Pike and are designed to reduce traffic congestion and the “ticket” toll system, the moves on the Boston Pike Extension and the Bridge/Harbor Tunnels would be huge changes.
Many local and state officials had no idea of the dramatic changes detailed in the filing until told by the newspaper, and all deferred comment until they could find out more information on the extensive plan.
Key members in the Legislature, however, tended to think the DOT was taking the half-a-loaf approach – asking for the full loaf in hopes of getting a half-loaf or even just a slice of bread.
Such changes can be implemented without Legislative approval – requiring only that Commissioners approve it. However, such a change would cost millions and that kind of appropriation would need to be approved by the State Legislature.",1086,886,200,30.570539712905884,65.03539991378784,"[[1.0000200271606445, 1.0000108480453491, 1.000016212463379, 1.000002145767212, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000165700912476, 1.0000134706497192, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000145435333252, 1.0000174045562744, 1.0000160932540894, 1.000016450881958, 1.0000163316726685, 1.0000019073486328, 1.000015139579773, 1.000016689300537, 1.000019907951355, 1.0000108480453491, 1.000016689300537, 1.000014066696167, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000150203704834, 1.0000075101852417, 1.0000120401382446, 1.0000115633010864, 1.0000146627426147, 1.0000094175338745, 1.0000104904174805, 1.00001060962677, 1.0000008344650269, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000032186508179, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000112056732178, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000063180923462, 1.0000180006027222, 1.000011920928955, 1.000018835067749, 1.0000067949295044, 1.0000042915344238, 1.0000165700912476, 1.000017762184143, 1.0000100135803223, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000015497207642, 1.0000063180923462, 1.0000196695327759, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000052452087402, 1.0000156164169312, 1.000011682510376, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000104904174805, 1.0000109672546387, 1.0000032186508179, 1.0000054836273193, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000158548355103, 1.0000132322311401, 1.000016212463379, 1.000022292137146, 1.000017523765564, 1.0000147819519043, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000178813934326, 1.000012755393982, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000090599060059, 1.0000027418136597, 1.0000104904174805, 1.0000118017196655, 1.0000114440917969, 1.0000170469284058, 1.000017762184143, 1.0000044107437134, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000017881393433, 1.000001311302185, 1.0000152587890625, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000097751617432, 1.000014305114746, 1.0000052452087402, 1.0000077486038208, 1.0000083446502686, 1.000004768371582, 1.000009298324585, 1.0000120401382446, 1.0000027418136597, 1.0000028610229492, 1.00001859664917, 1.00001060962677, 1.0000181198120117, 1.0000090599060059, 1.000004768371582, 1.0000190734863281, 1.0000064373016357, 1.0000121593475342, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000019073486328, 1.0000065565109253, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000150203704834, 1.0000085830688477, 1.0000073909759521, 1.0000015497207642, 1.0000184774398804, 1.0000203847885132, 1.000002145767212, 1.0000171661376953, 1.0000072717666626, 1.0000123977661133, 1.0000025033950806, 1.0000125169754028, 1.0000146627426147, 1.0000029802322388, 1.0000046491622925, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000158548355103, 1.0000104904174805, 1.0000174045562744, 1.0000123977661133, 1.0000141859054565, 1.0000053644180298, 1.0000183582305908, 1.0000063180923462, 1.0000048875808716, 1.0000035762786865, 1.0000176429748535, 1.0000073909759521, 1.0000135898590088, 1.0000123977661133, 1.0000118017196655, 1.0000110864639282, 1.000014305114746, 1.0000032186508179, 1.0000108480453491, 0.9999999403953552, 1.000001311302185, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000118017196655, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000157356262207, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000108480453491, 1.0000051259994507, 1.0000038146972656, 1.0000091791152954, 1.00001859664917, 1.0000139474868774, 1.0000044107437134, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000191926956177, 1.000009536743164, 1.0000168085098267, 1.0000115633010864, 1.0000073909759521, 1.0000056028366089, 1.0000066757202148, 1.0000011920928955, 1.000001072883606, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000015497207642, 1.0000202655792236, 1.0000189542770386, 1.0000139474868774, 1.0000184774398804, 1.0, 1.0000011920928955, 1.000011920928955, 1.0000011920928955, 1.000017523765564, 1.0000226497650146, 1.0000073909759521, 1.000010371208191, 1.0000076293945312, 1.0000079870224, 1.0000176429748535, 1.000014066696167, 1.0000218152999878, 1.000002145767212, 1.0000200271606445, 1.000014066696167, 1.0000189542770386, 1.0000226497650146, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000205039978027, 1.0000132322311401, 1.0000115633010864, 1.000015377998352, 1.0000213384628296, 1.000020980834961, 1.0000026226043701, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000081062316895]]"," all, it’s a long road to go for this plan, with one major concern remaining: the tolls on the Tobin Bridge and the harbor tunnels. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation is not that keen on the plan. The suspenstion, which has been looming for years, is the possibility of an environmental impact study – which is a long, hard road to accomplish.
The memorandum was filed with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) on July 28. Since then, there have been several meetings in various municipalities to discuss the strategy.
There was a meeting in Chelsea on August 3, with the idea of bringing down the cost of the project by pursuing mass user penalties. That did not go over well with the local groups.
“This is a very complex project. MassDOT’s plan is to simply be a back door to tolls,” said Councilor Jeffrey Whelan, who also serves on the state transportation commission"," all, the impact of all of the proposed changes could add $100 million to state revenues over the next 15 years, in addition to the $10 million to $12 million the state is already expected to collect from the tolling on the toll roads, according to the filing.
The final report is due to be finished by September 1, and the document will be published in the ‘Environmental Monitor’ – a publication that is usually reserved for project-specific information, but it is often used for general information as well.
Last week, Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack said the AETS project was on track, but would require a final report before it could be brought to the state’s Transportation Committee for a final vote. The Transportation Committee is expected to vote on the project sometime next month.

7860,"Chattanooga Railway. In a city famous for its ``choo choos,'' the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is billed as the world's steepest. Back in the 1880s, a group of Chattanooga businessmen built an elaborate hotel just below a famous point on Lookout Mountain. To convey guests to the hotel, they built a narrow-guage railway up the side of the mountain. Today the hotel is long gone, but the railway remains, and it gives passengers the chance to see one of Tennessee's most impressive views. For more details, write the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development, Room T, Box 23170, Nashville, TN 37202; or call (615) 741-7994. Going to France? Nearly 2,000 Americans were turned away at French borders this year for not having visas. To enter France, you must get a visa - a stamp in your passport showing it has been examined by the proper officals of that country - before you go. You'll need a valid passport, $15, one passport-sized photo of yourself, and an application form completed and signed. Visas are issued on the spot if you apply in person; by mail it takes up to three weeks. A visa is valid for three years and permits you to stay up to 90 days at a time. For application and instructions, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the French Consulate in your region or to the French Embassy, 4101 Reservoir Rd. N.W., Washington, DC 20007.
Memorize your passport number. You'll need it when you cash a traveler's check, fill out a customs form, or register at a hotel.
Take a sweater. Even if you're traveling in a tropical hot spot, an air-conditioned bus or restaurant may be uncomfortably chilly.
Don't automatically change your dollars to local currency. Many cities will take those dollars, and it saves constant switching back and forth to new money.
Take an umbrella. Hopefully it won't rain. If you're touring by bus, rack it there.
Use a camera that offers control over flash. You'll get more pictures. Often it's the flash, not the picture taking, that's objectionable.
Coordinate your watch with your guide's. If you don't, and your watch is slow, you may get left behind.

Airports get a boost. Airports are getting a much-needed boost with the addition of new gates, new facilities, and new passenger terminals. A new Terminal 5 at JFK airport in New York City is expected to open by the end of the year. This new terminal will be the largest airport terminal in the world. The project cost $1.2 billion and was funded by the state of New York. New gates at Logan International Airport in Boston will open this fall. A new gate at Washington Dulles International Airport will open in the fall. The new gates are being built at a cost of $120 million, and the new facilities are being built for an anticipated increase in passenger traffic in the"," more information, write the National Park Service, 231 N.

A vote against Iraq. In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, U.S. officials have conducted some of the most thorough and detailed investigations in their nation's history. The National Park Service alone has undertaken more than 200 investigations, and it has found more than 150 potential terrorist links to the nation's parks. The Park Service has also developed a program to train park employees in how to respond to suspicious activity. The effort is designed to encourage the reporting of suspicious activity to the authorities, while helping to mitigate the effects of that reporting on park service operations. The Park Service is asking visitors and park employees to report any suspicious activity to the following numbers: (888) 903-9623, (800) 744-8787, (800) 855-4671.",200,196,0.1612294137477875,0.3358394126502835,"{'num_tokens_scored': 189, 'num_green_tokens': 175, 'green_fraction': 0.9259259259259259, 'z_score': 1.188075180173738, 'p_value': 0.11740189588906519, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([0.3333, 0.4714, 0.5774, 0.6667, 0.7454, 0.8165, 0.8819, 0.9428, 1.0000,

3185,"The third season of Sons of Anarchy saw the motorcycle gang travel to Ireland and back, and ended with many of them going to prison. But while Jax (Charlie Hunnam) and Clay (Ron Perlman) patch up their relationship in jail, Tara finds out that Jax's deceased father and former leader of the motorcycle club feared that he would be killed by Clay and Gemma. We asked SOA creator Kurt Sutter about where he wants to take the fourth season, and when viewers can expect the crap to hit the fan.
TV Guide Magazine: What was the feedback you got for the third season?
Sutter: It's been primarily good. It's always a risk when you take your guys out of their main environment and I think when we went to Ireland people started wondering what that was about, but I think once we started to reveal the mythology about why we were going to Ireland and the weight of that on Jax. I saw that one of the sites was picking their favorite season and oddly enough Season 3 was up by three or four percent over season 2. So overall I think there was something fascinating about the scope of it, and going out of their environment. I love revealing the mythology, I love the whole IRA connection and the thematic weight of that. I'm a history guy, so there's a part of me that was digging on that.
TV Guide Magazine: Where do you see the fourth season going? Do you see more focus being placed on what happened to John?
Sutter: I think that always looms out there for Jax and I think the information he got this season will continue to impact him. But I think Season 4 will really be about dealing with the ramifications of all that new information, and it's a different Charming that they're coming back to. It's a different gun business for them. The 21st Century really starts to creep into the town and into the club.
TV Guide Magazine: What does that mean, specifically?
Sutter: I think ultimately there's a lot more progress in the town with Hale now becoming mayor there'll be a lot more development in the town. All the things they've been trying to avoid for years will ultimately start to creep in. If they can't keep Charming contained anymore, how do they deal with that?
TV Guide Magazine: Are you tempted to make it more about Clay and Jax and Gemma?
Sutter: I think ultimately, it is about the three of them and everything sort of is either background or devices to complicate all those relationships. I think Clay has a personal connection with Charming and there's something about the karmic weight of if he can keep that"," town small and safe, everything else we do is OK. So I think it's important for Clay to maintain that relationship with Charming. So it will be interesting to see how he deals with that this season.
TV Guide Magazine: I assume there will be another confrontation between Clay and Jax at some point.
Sutter: At some point. I think it's interesting that we opened those wounds up in Season 2 and then let them heal over in Season 3. I think one of the most powerful moments of the season for people was in the finale when Clay says to jax, 'I love you, son.' In contrast to what was going on last season, and I think there's almost a greater sense of betrayal when those wounds heal over and you ultimately rip the scab off again.

Sutter: Yep, he's in prison. He's been there for the last year, he's a good guy, he's a good guy, he's been in prison for a year. He's been an absolute model prisoner. I think it's a matter of him learning that he's going to get what he deserves.
TV Guide Magazine: Is he an expected character to show up in Season 4?
Sutter: I'm not sure if he's an expected character to show up but I think he'll be around, I think he'll be involved.
TV Guide Magazine: Do you think they'll have him fight in the next season?
Sutter: I think he's going to be a real part of things, but I think they've got a lot of other stuff going on.
TV Guide Magazine:"," from being kind of dissipated. Then of course Gemma's got this son that's the heir apparent and I think that's really interesting. I think ultimately we want to see those characters and we want to see them be a family. We also want to see them bond a little bit more as a family and see if there's a little bit more of Charming that's in there.
TV Guide Magazine: Are you surprised by the level of support the show has received from the general public?
Sutter: It's been phenomenal. I think we just got to the point where people are starting to know the characters better and they know what's going on. I think we're getting to the point where they're starting to understand the mythology and they understand what's going on.

7934,"NEWARK – Filling out his Winnipeg Jets lineup card has probably never been tougher for head coach Paul Maurice than it is right now.
That job only figures to become more challenging later this month with the expected return of defenceman Jacob Trouba and centre Adam Lowry from injury.
As the Jets get face to face the New York Rangers on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, Maurice isn’t planning to make any lineup changes after his team has posted consecutive victories to improve to 39-17-9 on the season.
Jets forward Brandon Tanev missed 10 consecutive games with an upper-body injury, but is expected to be a healthy scratch for the second contest in a row.
Just how does Maurice strike the balance between not wanting to change things up and finding room for a player that was an effective player for the Jets prior to the injury?
“That is a really good question and I’m working on that,” Maurice said after the Jets skated at the New Jersey Devils practice rink on Monday afternoon. “Fairly soon, if everything plays out, we’re going to have four extra healthy forwards that have all played for us.
Starting with training camp, the competition to both stay in the lineup and earn more ice time began in earnest.
But as injuries and opportunities occurred over the course of the season, youngsters like Kyle Connor and later Jack Roslovic have not just established themselves as regulars – they’re making an important contribution on the top two lines.
Connor is actually third on the Jets in goals (22) and sixth in points (41), which is even more impressive when you consider he started in the AHL and missed the first six games.
The addition of veteran centre Paul Stastny gave the Jets even more strength down the middle.
And after starting the campaign with what was basically a top-six and bottom-six forward group, the Jets have evolved into a team that features three scoring lines and a checking line, albeit one that can also chip in offensively.
Having that type of depth is a luxury the Jets haven’t really enjoyed during the six previous seasons.
It makes them a dangerous group to contend with and opposition coaches are being forced to make tough choices when it comes to which line to play the top defence pairing against.
Do you load up and try to contain Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler or do you send the shutdown group out against Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers?
And don’t forget about veterans like Little and Mathieu Perreault.
It essentially becomes a bit of a pick your poison situation.
Internal competition can be a driving force and bring out the best in players.
It can also make life difficult for those on the outside looking in – especially for guys who had been carving out a role like Tanev, as a penalty killer who uses his speed to create havoc on the forecheck.
The goal for every team is to win,"," but those clubs who are often the most successful find a way to make the necessary personal sacrifices while working hard enough to be ready whenever their number is called.
Winning often makes being a healthy scratch a bit more palatable, even though it’s never easy to accept.
“If you’re out of the lineup, obviously you want to be and be playing and be a part of it but for a team, it’s a good thing to have,” said Little. “The depth is so deep that you have good players out of your lineup and good players that are fighting for ice time and trying to get in. We can someone up and they’re NHL ready right off the bat and we’ve got guys fighting for spots in the lineup. We still have guys on the (Manitoba) Moose right now that aren’t even here that can probably step in pretty soon and be a player on this team.",814,614,200,12.153956890106201,62.43892312049866,"[[1.0000169277191162, 1.0000059604644775, 1.0000150203704834, 1.0000056028366089, 1.0000089406967163, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000004768371582, 1.0000158548355103, 1.0000094175338745, 1.0000077486038208, 1.000014066696167, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000090599060059, 1.0000114440917969, 1.000016212463379, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000114440917969, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000108480453491, 1.0000147819519043, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000026226043701, 1.0000115633010864, 1.0000146627426147, 1.000010371208191, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000041723251343, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000056028366089, 1.0, 1.0000114440917969, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000131130218506, 1.0000042915344238, 1.000010371208191, 1.0000115633010864, 1.000017523765564, 1.000015377998352, 1.0, 1.000007152557373, 1.0000075101852417, 1.000000238418579, 1.0000157356262207, 1.0000128746032715, 1.0000081062316895, 1.0000104904174805, 1.0000176429748535, 1.0000073909759521, 1.0000065565109253, 1.0000001192092896, 1.000001072883606, 1.0000157356262207, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000122785568237, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000033378601074, 1.0000078678131104, 1.0000022649765015, 1.0000078678131104, 1.000016450881958, 1.0000150203704834, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000030994415283, 1.0000134706497192, 1.0000028610229492, 1.0000042915344238, 1.000007152557373, 1.0000114440917969, 1.0000139474868774, 1.000000238418579, 1.0000076293945312, 1.0000001192092896, 1.0000094175338745, 1.0000152587890625, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000011920928955, 1.0000132322311401, 1.0000126361846924, 1.000002384185791, 1.0000088214874268, 1.0000176429748535, 1.0000156164169312, 0.9999998807907104, 1.0000005960464478, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000125169754028, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000066757202148, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000035762786865, 1.0000189542770386, 1.0000005960464478, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000150203704834, 1.0000028610229492, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000200271606445, 1.000000238418579, 1.0000096559524536, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000104904174805, 1.0000090599060059, 1.0000001192092896, 1.000010371208191, 1.000015139579773, 1.0, 1.0000005960464478, 1.0000017881393433, 1.0000019073486328, 1.0000028610229492, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000158548355103, 1.000011682510376, 1.0000102519989014, 1.000017762184143, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0, 1.0000008344650269, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000104904174805, 1.0000144243240356, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000141859054565, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000064373016357, 1.0000200271606445, 0.9999998807907104, 1.0000072717666626, 1.0000145435333252, 0.9999999403953552, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000170469284058, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000146627426147, 1.0000070333480835, 1.0000135898590088, 1.0000094175338745, 1.0000169277191162, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000029802322388, 1.0000168085098267, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000113248825073, 1.0000027418136597, 1.0000156164169312, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000159740447998, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000090599060059, 1.000012755393982, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000139474868774, 1.0000149011611938, 1.0000152587890625, 1.000015139579773, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000008344650269, 1.0000114440917969, 1.000011682510376, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000096559524536, 1.0000158548355103, 1.0000067949295044, 1.0000135898590088, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000150203704834, 1.0000088214874268, 1.0000147819519043, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000131130218506, 1.000004768371582, 1.0000168085098267, 1.0, 1.000001311302185, 1.0000121593475342, 1.000008463859558, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000146627426147, 1.0000115633010864, 1.0000134706497192, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0000015497207642, 1.0000123977661133, 1.0000108480453491, 1.0000156164169312, 1.000006079673767, 1.0000190734863281, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000118017196655, 1.0000184774398804, 1.0000001192092896, 1.0000001192092896, 1.0000075101852417, 1.000000238418579]]"," no matter what circumstances.
“When you’re in that position, you have to take advantage of it and that’s what we’ve been trying to do,” Tanev said.
“I think we’ve been pretty successful at it so far and we’re going to keep doing it.”"," but Maurice said there’s a fine line between trying to win every game and trying to win when the stakes are high.
Injuries to Trouba and Lowry are a big reason why.
Trouba has been one of the team’s most consistent performers and is a key component to a strong defence and a strong penalty kill.
“He’s been the only guy that’s played on a line with Scheifele and Laine,” Maurice said. “It� Soverevely helps you when you have somebody that’s been around for a while.
“They’ve played together for a long time. They’ve played together in the AHL. They’ve played together in Europe. They’ve played together for a long time in Winnipeg.
“So it’s a big deal. He’s a big part of this group.”

9583,"The Bears already made one major move to strengthen the offensive line when they signed left tackle Jermon Bushrod. This will create competition at right tackle, as Gabe Carimi and J'Marcus Webb will each push to earn the starting job. But the Bears still need to think about guards, and that's one area they can address with the draft.
Chance Warmack from Alabama is one of the best options for the Bears out of the draft. As a 6-foot-2, 317-lb. guard, he could fill holes in the Bears' interior line. He is known as a"," powerful run blocker, which would make Matt Forte quite happy.
The National Football Post says he has a nasty edge to his game, which the Bears line has been lacking since Olin Kreutz left the team. Part of keeping the quarterback safe means punishing the defenders who dare lay a hand on him. Warmack has the game to make it happen.
And it's not a bad idea for the Bears to bring in young, fresh talent on the interior. Lance Louis is a free agent who is coming off an ACL tear, and he still may not return. Roberto Garza just turned 34, and Chris Spencer and James Brown aren't as reliable the Bears need them to be.
Plus, that name! Think of all the headlines we can come up with the name Chance Warmack. It's a great, great football name that would fit well on the back of a Bears jersey. If he's available when the Bears pick at 20, Warmack would make sense for Chicago.",321,121,200,15.084338426589966,56.868754148483276,"[[1.0000033378601074, 1.000004768371582, 1.0000073909759521, 1.0000097751617432, 1.0000097751617432, 1.0000016689300537, 1.000017762184143, 1.000001072883606, 1.0000029802322388, 1.0000205039978027, 1.0000196695327759, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000014305114746, 1.0000090599060059, 1.0000205039978027, 1.0000203847885132, 1.000011920928955, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000078678131104, 1.000009298324585, 1.0000032186508179, 1.0000054836273193, 1.0000147819519043, 1.0000061988830566, 1.0000180006027222, 1.0000146627426147, 1.000016212463379, 1.000013828277588, 1.0000046491622925, 1.0000042915344238, 1.0000157356262207, 1.0000090599060059, 1.000015377998352, 1.0000030994415283, 1.0000033378601074, 1.0000152587890625, 1.0000147819519043, 1.0000066757202148, 1.0000052452087402, 1.000013828277588, 1.000017523765564, 1.0000181198120117, 1.0000126361846924, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000091791152954, 1.000013828277588, 1.0000174045562744, 1.0000051259994507, 1.000014305114746, 1.000018835067749, 1.0000022649765015, 1.0000123977661133, 1.0000168085098267, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000120401382446, 1.0000182390213013, 1.000016212463379, 1.00001859664917, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000040531158447, 1.0000079870224, 1.0000053644180298, 1.000016212463379, 1.00001060962677, 1.0000154972076416, 1.000008463859558, 1.0000008344650269, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000149011611938, 1.0000019073486328, 1.0000022649765015, 1.0000132322311401, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000147819519043, 1.000004529953003, 1.0000180006027222, 1.0000007152557373, 1.0000256299972534, 1.0000008344650269, 1.0000014305114746, 1.0000005960464478, 1.0000003576278687, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000145435333252, 1.000002145767212, 1.0000075101852417, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000121593475342, 1.0000015497207642, 1.000006914138794, 1.0000051259994507, 1.000011682510376, 1.0000219345092773, 1.000001311302185, 1.000008225440979, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000147819519043, 1.0000076293945312, 1.0000152587890625, 1.000015139579773, 1.0000020265579224, 1.0000066757202148, 1.0000126361846924, 1.000009298324585, 1.0000054836273193, 1.0000020265579224, 1.0000011920928955, 1.000004768371582, 1.0000110864639282, 1.0000121593475342, 1.0000077486038208, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000057220458984, 1.0000133514404297, 1.000016450881958, 1.0000133514404297, 1.0000102519989014, 1.0000141859054565, 1.000005841255188, 1.0000182390213013, 1.0000181198120117, 1.0000044107437134, 1.0000181198120117, 1.0000108480453491, 1.000014066696167, 1.0000112056732178, 1.0000028610229492, 1.0000172853469849, 1.0000146627426147, 1.0000072717666626, 1.0000030994415283, 1.000009298324585, 1.0000076293945312, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000147819519043, 1.0000147819519043, 1.0000096559524536, 1.0000122785568237, 1.0000113248825073, 1.000016450881958, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000157356262207, 1.0000098943710327, 1.0000178813934326, 1.0000150203704834, 1.0000157356262207, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000169277191162, 1.0000132322311401, 1.0000075101852417, 1.0000066757202148, 1.0000083446502686, 1.0000041723251343, 1.0000157356262207, 1.0000078678131104, 1.0000033378601074, 1.0000081062316895, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000183582305908, 1.000016689300537, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000144243240356, 1.0000038146972656, 1.0000137090682983, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000112056732178, 1.0000078678131104, 1.000014066696167, 1.0000171661376953, 1.0000160932540894, 1.0000114440917969, 1.0000057220458984, 1.0000159740447998, 1.0000168085098267, 1.0000078678131104, 1.0000163316726685, 1.0000154972076416, 1.0000202655792236, 1.0000050067901611, 1.0000064373016357, 1.000016450881958, 1.000003457069397, 1.0000150203704834, 1.000014066696167, 1.000016689300537, 1.0000156164169312, 1.0000073909759521, 1.0000189542770386, 1.0000181198120117, 1.0000150203704834, 1.0000096559524536, 1.000014305114746, 1.0000107288360596, 1.0000157356262207, 1.0000168085098267, 1.000016212463379, 1.0000172853469849]]"," player who has great ability along the offensive line. Warmack had a good year for the Crimson Tide, but he showed some weaknesses in the Big 12. He allowed pressure on only 26.6 percent of his pass-blocking snaps, per Pro Football Focus. He has a lot of experience, and he's a good fit for the Bears at guard.
A second-round pick, Warmack could be available when the Bears pick at No. 41 overall. He would be a great pick for them if they don't trade up to get him. Plus, he would likely slide down to the Bears' pick at No. 42, which they could also consider."," great run blocker who excels at getting off the ball and getting to the second level quickly. With his size and length, he's able to rush the passer and handle double teams effectively. He would be a good fit in the Bears' offense as a right tackle, but he could play guard as well if the Bears need to replace Kyle Long.
Another option for the Bears is Laremy Tunsil from Ole Miss. The 6-foot-4, 330-lb. tackle is a pure guard who is a massive run blocker who can handle double teams. He is also noted for being very quick off the ball and getting to the second level quickly. With his size and length, he is a great fit for the Bears because he is so hard to bring down.
While the Bears need to address right tackle, they also need to address the offensive line in general with the 53-man roster. This is one of the most important positions on the roster because it is so important",135,200,0.11173584019696271,0.2843437707424164,"{'num_tokens_scored': 181, 'num_green_tokens': 166, 'green_fraction': 0.9171270718232044, 'z_score': 0.7680706177887373, 'p_value': 0.22122261591231301, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 0.3333,  0.4714,  0.5774,  0.6667,  0.7454, -0.5443, -0.3780, -1.4142,
