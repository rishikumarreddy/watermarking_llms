9793,"""As it becomes more difficult to defend Obama, the probability of a charge of racism approaches.""
""It is becoming well nigh impossible to deny the racist overtones of these protests.""
What, may you ask, is the strongest argument for this astounding claim?
""Many of the virtually all-white crowd on Saturday yearned for an earlier time with less government involvement in society.""
You read that correctly: the fact that this crowd was predominantly caucasian (by Winters&apos; account), proves that it must be racist. By Winters&apos; logic, the United States Senate must be ""racist"" - it is ""virtually all-white"", after all.
""But, that earlier time [of less government involvement in society] recalls, for many of us, the memory of states’ rights being enforced through dogs and water cannons.""
3)... the anti-tax marchers want a return to racial segregation.
That is Winters&apos; argument, in three easy steps.
Liberal Catholics will go ballistic when a conservative Catholic writer makes an absurd argument, and demand that fellow conservatives disown the maverick&apos;s argument. Because, on the whole, we strive to be reasonable and agreeable people, we typically do so. We can call one of our own out of bounds without feeling we&apos;ve eroded our common arguments. We can call crazy ""crazy"" because we try to avoid it. Winters seems to be reduced to just writing crazy.
Well, in similar fashion",", I&apos;d like to see some ""liberal"" Catholic writers take Winters to the woodshed for this one. People who don&apos;t like Obama don&apos;t like him because they are racist - really?! Is anyone typically sympathetic to Winters prepared to defend this claim of his? There are many more people in America who did not attend this march who are sympathetic to the concerns of those who did attend. Are all of them equally guilty of the racism Winters ascribes?
I&apos;ll be waiting for such logical reflection on these claims Winters has injected into the debate.
But frankly, until Winters himself retracts this stupidity, I&apos;ll feel free to disregard him completely.
After all, I shouldn&apos;t give my time to someone who writes for a racist magazine like America.
I mean, just look at the complexion of that magazine&apos;s editors.",522,322,200,81.51903939247131,92.48122668266296,"[[0.41949015855789185, 0.9130409955978394, 0.9557377696037292, 0.6442604660987854, 0.5261761546134949, 0.28311771154403687, 0.6064758896827698, 0.3410889208316803, 0.9194996356964111, 0.8132389783859253, 0.7252284288406372, 0.7375558018684387, 0.6868534684181213, 0.2502891421318054, 0.8010163307189941, 0.80632084608078, 0.7320278882980347, 0.7079107165336609, 0.4665721356868744, 0.7572691440582275, 0.9570183753967285, 0.48842817544937134, 0.45581626892089844, 0.832230806350708, 0.899838924407959, 0.7399652600288391, 0.641898512840271, 0.430457204580307, 0.26362723112106323, 0.5394768118858337, 0.8065962791442871, 0.3172222375869751, 0.3352624773979187, 0.2582527995109558, 0.2662978172302246, 0.4002437889575958, 0.2867198884487152, 0.27145227789878845, 0.28669530153274536, 0.2546662390232086, 0.25426676869392395, 0.2533186078071594, 0.2528608739376068, 0.2611274719238281, 0.6046057343482971, 0.8339493870735168, 0.9740269780158997, 0.9159504771232605, 0.787263810634613, 0.41831183433532715, 0.909455418586731, 0.4490702450275421, 0.8047245144844055, 0.85997474193573, 0.9408438801765442, 0.7748910784721375, 0.3946298658847809, 0.9034454822540283, 0.6987693309783936, 0.5118674635887146, 0.6908552646636963, 0.6422073245048523, 0.32840481400489807, 0.3174439072608948, 0.43919071555137634, 0.5381249785423279, 0.45500481128692627, 0.5058727264404297, 0.3654634356498718, 0.3006790280342102, 0.26194557547569275, 0.363100528717041, 0.49556922912597656, 0.38496482372283936, 0.3829682469367981, 0.2911264896392822, 0.29725345969200134, 0.2565336525440216, 0.3485732674598694, 0.4092024862766266, 0.31486085057258606, 0.3083231747150421, 0.271566778421402, 0.28412264585494995, 0.25457480549812317, 0.34618499875068665, 0.43830835819244385, 0.2842769920825958, 0.2995694875717163, 0.2644937038421631, 0.27286526560783386, 0.2530587315559387, 0.4167061746120453, 0.30162495374679565, 0.2696749269962311, 0.26934361457824707, 0.26065513491630554, 0.2652553617954254, 0.2527366280555725, 0.41843295097351074, 0.32094183564186096, 0.26739534735679626, 0.261651873588562, 0.2597540020942688, 0.2621930241584778, 0.25261276960372925, 0.4130840003490448, 0.3145163655281067, 0.2622927129268646, 0.2584250271320343, 0.2588617503643036, 0.2610492706298828, 0.2523893415927887, 0.4042297899723053, 0.3048667311668396, 0.26018190383911133, 0.2567257881164551, 0.25797155499458313, 0.2600266635417938, 0.2522343099117279, 0.39530518651008606, 0.3009072542190552, 0.25887084007263184, 0.25598227977752686, 0.2573692500591278, 0.25903481245040894, 0.25227048993110657, 0.38300463557243347, 0.28850510716438293, 0.25871872901916504, 0.25586289167404175, 0.2566569149494171, 0.2581529915332794, 0.2520412802696228, 0.3985571563243866, 0.2929631173610687, 0.25785017013549805, 0.25486117601394653, 0.2562779486179352, 0.25668999552726746, 0.25197833776474, 0.3914021849632263, 0.2943689823150635, 0.2571370303630829, 0.25430214405059814, 0.25588056445121765, 0.25637659430503845, 0.25174036622047424, 0.3840858042240143, 0.29324913024902344, 0.2567487955093384, 0.25386688113212585, 0.25510555505752563, 0.255999356508255, 0.2515510618686676, 0.37652507424354553, 0.28931567072868347, 0.25610828399658203, 0.25360944867134094, 0.25438934564590454, 0.2556970417499542, 0.2513997256755829, 0.3707939684391022, 0.2855505347251892, 0.2557998597621918, 0.2534303367137909, 0.25389471650123596, 0.25546911358833313, 0.2513219118118286, 0.36332833766937256, 0.2856976389884949, 0.2559153735637665, 0.25357353687286377, 0.2536097764968872, 0.2555723488330841, 0.25131627917289734, 0.3601438105106354, 0.2812444865703583, 0.2558174431324005, 0.2533637583255768, 0.2531951367855072, 0.25534218549728394, 0.2511875629425049, 0.3604201078414917, 0.27388298511505127, 0.2553284764289856, 0.2529768645763397, 0.25286224484443665, 0.255339652299881, 0.25111138820648193, 0.362048476934433, 0.27009841799736023, 0.2548511028289795, 0.25262850522994995, 0.25253862142562866, 0.2548949420452118, 0.25098371505737305, 0.3654126822948456, 0.26104819774627686, 0.25414711236953735]]",", when a conservative Catholic writer calls out liberal Catholics for their tendency to bend to the whims of Santa Claus, conservatives are quick to denounce the writer as a rude, contemptible, and uncivil person.

This may be the most comprehensive guide to becoming an entrepreneur that I’ve ever read. How incredibly helpful!

I’m not an entrepreneur, but I’ve been in the business world for over 10 years now. I’ve been out of the workforce for about 9 of those years and while I’ve had some great experiences and gotten a lot accomplished, I still feel like I’ve got a lot to learn.

You’ve written an awesome book on how to get out of your job and into an entrepreneurial role. But, you didn’t give us any details on how you’re doing that. What’s your “business model”? What are your “success conditions”?

I think that’s one of the great things about this book. The book doesn’t give you a", foundation to identifying what motivates you professionally will Pamela guide your business forward. The tools discussed help to build an enterprise of your dreams that you will be satisfied within and your business is on a more consistent path forward. What is more important to start a new business is a healthy balance between entrepreneurship (being your true self - being your authentic you!) while maintaining your work life to provide a steady stream of passive work to your income producing asset that is a true asset to you! The tools discussed are easy to follow guidelines to ensure your personal path is a healthy one as each entrepreneur is unique. Pamela is happy her own transformation has resulted from her being her authentic authentic true self - something so important to any successful life - to being true to her authentic authentic true self - something so important to any successful life - to being true to her authentic authentic true self. The tools discussed are easy to follow guidelines to ensure your personal path is a healthy one as each entrepreneur is unique.

3801,"With so many hoops to jump through to close transactions, falling home prices, and unrealistic sellers and buyers, today’s agents have to hustle harder than ever before. This doesn’t have to be the case. With the right systems and the right processes in place, you can work smarter rather than hustling harder.
Everyone has systems. The question is: Which systems support your business to thrive vs. which systems create a drag on your production? A system can be as simple as taking a different route to work each day to search for for-sale-by-owner homes, or as complex as doing all your business online.
The hallmarks of a strong system are that it is repeatable, it reduces time and effort, and it yields consistent results. If you’re interested in working smarter rather than hustling harder, here are five areas where you can begin to systematize your business.
If you’re like most agents, you have multiple phone numbers on your business card. It’s much easier for clients to contact you on a single phone number. One of the simplest solutions is to use Google Voice. Google Voice provides you with a single phone number that goes to every one of your phones in the order you specify.
Your clients can find you easily, no matter where you are. Google Voice also allows you to keep your cell phone and your home phone private. When you are in a situation where you cannot take a voice call, Google Voice can transcribe your message into an email or text message. Surprisingly, there is no charge for this service, and it works both in the U.S. and Canada.
An increasing number of companies and agents are electing to go paperless. Many associations already publish their various contracts in a digital format. You can download these forms to any type of computer. They may also be available in the ""cloud,"" using systems such as DocuSign. Digital signatures can be obtained either through the equivalent of a lock-and-key approach (think of your credit card number tied to a password) or with an actual digital signature. On the tablet PCs, your clients sign their documents with a light pen. On the iPad, they can sign using their finger with apps such as Zosh.
Another way to go paperless is to create a digital pre-list package. In addition to the various forms and documents required to close a transaction, you can include a sample 90-day marketing plan, a digital brochure of the seller’s property, plus a link to the single-property website that you create for your sellers. Going paperless is one of the most effective ways to save both time and gasoline costs.
Many agents struggle with the idea of starting and maintaining a blog. There’s a simple solution, and it’s right in the outbox of your email. If you’re like most agents, you haven’t cleaned your outbox recently. If this is the case, look back through your past emails. Every email where you answered a client question is a potential blog post.
A simple way to create great content for your blog is to answer client questions using your blog rather than your email. Post both the question and the answer in your blog. You can also post market updates plus upcoming neighborhood events.
If you enjoy taking photos or videos, post them on your blog or your Facebook business page. Since most blogging platforms allow you to schedule your posts at a later date, increase the effectiveness of your system by doing all of your posts at the same time each week. Plug in the time and date you want the post published and the blogging platform handles it automatically.
Your interactions on social media are another great area to systematize. For example, if you have 150 Facebook friends, take 10 minutes each day to either ""like"" or comment on something that five of your friends post. At the end of the month, you will have contacted all 150 of your friends at least once.
Another approach is to use a system such as HootSuite. When you come across an article, picture, blog post, or some other online material that you believe your friends or followers may like, you can click the ""Tweet this"" button and HootSuite automatically creates a Tweet and posts to Facebook as well.
You can send the Tweet as is or modify it. The process takes just a few seconds and allows you to provide your followers with great information with a minimal amount of effort.","
How much time do you spend entering notes you have taken at listing appointments, inspections or walkthroughs on your computer? The paid version of Evernote allows you to take notes on your smartphone, iPad or personal computer. Evernote then makes those notes available on all of your Evernote-enabled devices simultaneously.
Instead of wasting time transferring this information from a handwritten form into a digital format, Evernote eliminates having to enter data twice saving you tremendous amounts of time and effort.
Which systems are best for you? The real test is in finding a system and then developing the habit of working with it regularly. The more you work with a system, the more efficient your use of the system becomes.
If the increasingly fast pace of the real estate business is draining your energy, a systems approach may be exactly what you need to put you back in control.

1713,"The value of Saudi industrial exports reached SR162 billion by the end of 2012 compared to SR110 million in 1974, Director General of Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) Ali Al-Ayed said.
Addressing a GCC industrial event in Oman, Al-Ayed said Saudi industrial exports have achieved high growth rates averaging 20 percent per year in the period 1974-2012.
It was organized by the Omani Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) in coordination with the Riyadh-based GCC general secretariat.
The SIDF chief attributed the robust growth of the industrial exports to the availability of hydrocarbons at preferential prices in addition to the conclusion of international and regional trade agreements to this end.
Plastic and chemical products accounted for 77"," percent of the total industrial exports in that year, followed by food products at 8 percent, base metals (6 percent), and electric devices and equipment (2 percent), he told the conference.
He said the SIDF used to adopt a series of measures to boost industrial exports, including attraction of foreign investments which had an effective role in transferring experience and technical know-how.
SIDF has approved SR42.2 billion, or 38 percent of total loans, for the industrial projects, he said.
He also enumerated a series of challenges facing local industries, notably how to diversify production and export base for local industries, upgrade technical knowledge, minimize global competition on local products, and how to boost efficiency of export logistics services.
The SIDF chief explored a number of recommendations for the development of national exports, including creation of a national strategy to develop industrial exports, expansion of regional and international trade cooperation and spread of awareness among investors and officials on the importance of exports.",362,162,200,43.80908751487732,86.04600882530212,"[[0.36457085609436035, 0.2878229022026062, 0.503611147403717, 0.39605364203453064, 0.8454091548919678, 0.7236993908882141, 0.4902120530605316, 0.7769092917442322, 0.982768177986145, 0.382869154214859, 0.810172975063324, 0.25739288330078125, 0.6990100741386414, 0.9340264797210693, 0.6629996299743652, 0.8530018329620361, 0.9430434107780457, 0.5936311483383179, 0.4174264371395111, 0.9210483431816101, 0.4223116338253021, 0.814742922782898, 0.736354649066925, 0.25224220752716064, 0.9163399934768677, 0.30349743366241455, 0.6273853182792664, 0.5816117525100708, 0.5935215950012207, 0.5486905574798584, 0.6626532673835754, 0.49083155393600464, 0.27133697271347046, 0.9438963532447815, 0.3903970420360565, 0.7401813864707947, 0.2583731412887573, 0.45400992035865784, 0.6093178987503052, 0.3959609866142273, 0.3692019283771515, 0.4279555082321167, 0.8843272924423218, 0.8609219193458557, 0.6127214431762695, 0.9556697607040405, 0.38742998242378235, 0.7770885229110718, 0.7183414101600647, 0.5661711692810059, 0.7613250613212585, 0.5852206349372864, 0.8271254301071167, 0.3574475646018982, 0.5857090353965759, 0.7593137621879578, 0.37105870246887207, 0.414621502161026, 0.34419217705726624, 0.753542423248291, 0.9286365509033203, 0.40991848707199097, 0.6638012528419495, 0.8410669565200806, 0.5193535089492798, 0.34687989950180054, 0.3458746373653412, 0.4590582847595215, 0.34207093715667725, 0.35148847103118896, 0.908072829246521, 0.2574292719364166, 0.6016004681587219, 0.9710409641265869, 0.9238656163215637, 0.9163604378700256, 0.8911209106445312, 0.8699212074279785, 0.2686070501804352, 0.8597137331962585, 0.6946824193000793, 0.799351155757904, 0.490195095539093, 0.8010326623916626, 0.9462028741836548, 0.8501170873641968, 0.3100511431694031, 0.7544724941253662, 0.7824037671089172, 0.48743051290512085, 0.6300301551818848, 0.814503014087677, 0.8215453028678894, 0.6496610045433044, 0.665623128414154, 0.8442190885543823, 0.943920373916626, 0.7298023700714111, 0.7768698930740356, 0.6231168508529663, 0.5517730116844177, 0.9052953720092773, 0.8208963871002197, 0.5327334403991699, 0.9546655416488647, 0.6544516086578369, 0.5016327500343323, 0.9474999308586121, 0.6885172724723816, 0.36646386981010437, 0.2675156891345978, 0.38623613119125366, 0.6920737624168396, 0.8813042044639587, 0.4664069414138794, 0.5028693079948425, 0.8189870119094849, 0.5733775496482849, 0.7174760699272156, 0.5709338784217834, 0.5873278379440308, 0.9046199321746826, 0.7494158148765564, 0.7475997805595398, 0.32420068979263306, 0.5299457907676697, 0.7833244204521179, 0.5331842303276062, 0.5024933218955994, 0.36442670226097107, 0.5168524980545044, 0.4991149306297302, 0.3239569664001465, 0.2693638801574707, 0.2539311349391937, 0.40091705322265625, 0.43078193068504333, 0.27836835384368896, 0.3226361870765686, 0.3141096234321594, 0.3175438642501831, 0.3414157032966614, 0.2615201771259308, 0.2579433023929596, 0.3911711573600769, 0.27017727494239807, 0.27883413434028625, 0.2595598101615906, 0.2739827632904053, 0.2544940710067749, 0.253396600484848, 0.25600892305374146, 0.2503993809223175, 0.2531895041465759, 0.5079647302627563, 0.259939968585968, 0.2616690993309021, 0.2559156119823456, 0.25281938910484314, 0.26883870363235474, 0.29355618357658386, 0.2561635673046112, 0.2637525200843811, 0.2740578353404999, 0.2837534546852112, 0.31937605142593384, 0.25613412261009216, 0.2546490430831909, 0.3172316551208496, 0.2632600963115692, 0.26983171701431274, 0.2570202052593231, 0.2554919719696045, 0.25260552763938904, 0.25131309032440186, 0.25278371572494507, 0.2504255175590515, 0.25238385796546936, 0.31155043840408325, 0.25260838866233826, 0.25331205129623413, 0.25288471579551697, 0.2517465651035309, 0.2615860104560852, 0.25644126534461975, 0.2536255717277527, 0.25754159688949585, 0.25703194737434387, 0.2586256265640259, 0.26598232984542847, 0.25203245878219604, 0.25224950909614563, 0.28152164816856384, 0.26049450039863586, 0.26088011264801025, 0.25352275371551514, 0.2517869770526886, 0.2515086829662323, 0.25058266520500183, 0.25090739130973816]]"," percent of the export value, followed by finished electrical and electronic goods, automotive products, machinery and equipment, as well as food and beverages, and metal products.

9232,"Although the case has not advanced to the point where he’s assigned it to prosecutors, Campbell said there was a good chance Cappleman, who is one of four top prosecutors in his office, could have been involved.
But Campbell said the conflict wouldn’t prevent other prosecutors at the office from prosecuting Latvala.
“There’s no conflict,” Campbell said.
Latvala, 66, was at the pinnacle of his power as Senate budget chairman until allegations of sexual harassment, first reported by Politico, surfaced in November.
The Senate initiated two investigations, including hiring retired Judge Ronald Swanson to serve as special master. On Dec. 19, Swanson found probable cause that Latvala had violated Senate misconduct rules and sexually harassed a legislative aide. Swanson also said that Latvala may have violated state corruption laws by seeking sexual intimacy with a lobbyist in exchange for legislative favors.
Investigators, led by the head of FDLE’s executive investigations team, Scott McInerney, have still not reached out to key players, including Latvala and the lobbyist, Laura McLeod, lawyers for both said Tuesday.
Around the time the harassment"," allegations surfaced, Latvala hired Chaires, a former Leon County sheriff’s deputy, according to Latvala’s attorney, Steven R. Andrews.
Chaires, who owns Warrior Security Contractors, did not turn up any listening devices, he said.
Andrews noted that the work was completed before any potential criminal charges had emerged. Chaires was paid the $645 — not even a full day’s work for a typical investigator — on Dec. 11, nine days before Latvala resigned.
Andrews said he was not aware that Chaires was married to the deputy assistant state attorney.
Criminal defense lawyers told the Times/Herald that Campbell did the right thing in removing Cappleman, who is also a candidate for judge, from a potential Latvala case.

Latvala said the sale was made to pay for a family vacation.
“The allegations against me are false and hurtful,” Latvala said in a statement in November. “I have cooperated fully with the investigation, and I will continue to do so.”
In a statement Tuesday, McLeod said she did not “have a comment on the status of the case.”
The case is being handled by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Office of Special Investigations, which is made up of seven current and former law enforcement officers. McInerney, who was hired by FDLE in 2009, has been leading the probe for months.

1387,"Premera Blue Cross Cyberattack Exposed Millions Of Customer Records : All Tech Considered The health insurance provider has revealed that a cyberattack discovered in January may have made the medical and financial information of 11 million people vulnerable to thieves.
Another big health insurance company has revealed it has been the target of a massive cyberattack.
Premera Blue Cross says hackers may have taken up to 11 million customer records. Those records include credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, even information about medical problems. This news is just coming out but Premera issued a statement saying it discovered the breach on Jan. 29. That's about the same date that Anthem, another Blue Cross company, told the FBI that it was breached.
It's possible that Anthem put the word out and, given the timelines, the attacks were related — done by the same perpetrator. At least that's an educated guess from the cybersecurity company iSight Partners.
Premera also says the attack itself started in May of last year. But iSight found a suspicious domain called ""prennera.com,"" an address that may have been made to spoof Premera's official website. It was created in December 2013.
Either way, that's many, many months to steal people's data. NPR has reported previously on the black market for credit cards and health records. Will a bunch of for-sale signs go up there? Probably not this time — or at least that's according to sources who hang out in the underground.
Health care data can be more valuable than credit card information on the black market. But so far, sources say, the Anthem data hasn't shown up on the underground sites. And Premera may not either. It could be that the hackers are not run-of-the-mill criminals, but in it for cyber-espionage.
Yes, cyber-espionage. As in spies. It's possible that a nation-state actor is involved.
Both health care companies are huge providers with lots of government workers. So if someone wants intel on Defense Department employees — where they live, spouses' names, serious (or embarrassing) medical conditions, a breach is a way to stockpile that data and use it for blackmail later.
As iSight malware analyst Brian Bartholomew says: ""The sole purpose of espionage is to steal information, gain advantage. By publicizing, you're giving up the leverage you have.""
NPR has asked Premera and the FBI whether they are alerting other health care providers to watch out or providing details other companies might benefit from. Neither has immediately responded to our inquiry.
There's another group called the National Healthcare ISAC (Information-sharing"," and Analysis Center) that helps to share breach information. They say they've been in contact with private investigators at Mandiant as well as federal investigators handling the case. So far, the specific ways that Premera was attacked — like the IP addresses the attacks came from or the specific types of malware — have not been declassified and shared with other potential targets.
Director Deborah Kobza says in an email, ""It is only through coordinated sector and cross-sector cybersecurity information sharing, that we, as a nation, can move critical infrastructure cybersecurity protection from a reactive to proactive stance.""
But what is Premera doing to protect victims — the up to 11 million people who may be affected here? Premera says it is offering two years of free credit monitoring. It's the same kind of protection that retailers and financial institutions have given victims of credit card hacking. But if the point of this theft is altogether different, espionage, then identity monitoring doesn't really help in the end.",753,553,200,39.92284059524536,102.02133345603943,"[[0.6023693084716797, 0.7401314973831177, 0.25088736414909363, 0.9365800023078918, 0.26937127113342285, 0.5295097231864929, 0.9017162322998047, 0.7934306859970093, 0.49619531631469727, 0.5349838137626648, 0.701774001121521, 0.5376319885253906, 0.8113535642623901, 0.5986717939376831, 0.41016918420791626, 0.5914516448974609, 0.25221893191337585, 0.7070358395576477, 0.39047905802726746, 0.7872959971427917, 0.6594178676605225, 0.250414103269577, 0.2786450982093811, 0.7881996631622314, 0.4761837422847748, 0.5522544980049133, 0.48654574155807495, 0.5000446438789368, 0.41867896914482117, 0.3640097975730896, 0.5754321217536926, 0.3703724145889282, 0.284787654876709, 0.47031524777412415, 0.7834933996200562, 0.6509177088737488, 0.4719108045101166, 0.7640181183815002, 0.6221274733543396, 0.526594340801239, 0.7589864730834961, 0.8266973495483398, 0.5790376663208008, 0.33978018164634705, 0.6606936454772949, 0.7346453666687012, 0.3711572289466858, 0.8979591131210327, 0.7896901965141296, 0.3584664463996887, 0.7480062246322632, 0.7936089038848877, 0.7632445096969604, 0.6616074442863464, 0.7610358595848083, 0.8184552192687988, 0.7309314012527466, 0.7299181818962097, 0.7462096810340881, 0.40149199962615967, 0.5317364931106567, 0.4949859082698822, 0.3866318464279175, 0.3637009859085083, 0.7942419052124023, 0.6833333969116211, 0.6424484848976135, 0.6579203009605408, 0.6853777766227722, 0.6837688684463501, 0.7798855900764465, 0.8456476926803589, 0.9094657301902771, 0.5509857535362244, 0.8774388432502747, 0.29210522770881653, 0.4831814169883728, 0.519222617149353, 0.2565454840660095, 0.47202780842781067, 0.6888290643692017, 0.711642324924469, 0.3785804212093353, 0.6271562576293945, 0.39006781578063965, 0.6992077231407166, 0.7505923509597778, 0.49784404039382935, 0.40306565165519714, 0.5477071404457092, 0.682023286819458, 0.4714014232158661, 0.4591403305530548, 0.9035096168518066, 0.8040629029273987, 0.3634222745895386, 0.8882073163986206, 0.8167902827262878, 0.9482775330543518, 0.8490499258041382, 0.5846480131149292, 0.7112773656845093, 0.502150297164917, 0.6828583478927612, 0.7342878580093384, 0.8877096772193909, 0.8016025424003601, 0.6807159185409546, 0.7606720328330994, 0.7636750340461731, 0.6577516198158264, 0.6306470632553101, 0.8813149929046631, 0.7636213898658752, 0.49039167165756226, 0.3935728371143341, 0.841265082359314, 0.60491544008255, 0.7432358860969543, 0.4174777567386627, 0.91603684425354, 0.9200057983398438, 0.9478689432144165, 0.40390366315841675, 0.9035256505012512, 0.7518176436424255, 0.7916957139968872, 0.7144091725349426, 0.8995206952095032, 0.5086077451705933, 0.6754181385040283, 0.6898015141487122, 0.8086916208267212, 0.7944011092185974, 0.7906395792961121, 0.6894434690475464, 0.7175337672233582, 0.3929111957550049, 0.3951755166053772, 0.5215734243392944, 0.33484095335006714, 0.4809599816799164, 0.29031234979629517, 0.29730093479156494, 0.28825777769088745, 0.26973190903663635, 0.2543601095676422, 0.26785269379615784, 0.2889825999736786, 0.25453466176986694, 0.2547840178012848, 0.2928895056247711, 0.2543923258781433, 0.2703494727611542, 0.29787594079971313, 0.25076332688331604, 0.2502530515193939, 0.25658154487609863, 0.25284823775291443, 0.25132080912590027, 0.2509037256240845, 0.25111421942710876, 0.2579643130302429, 0.2610119581222534, 0.25503090023994446, 0.2503837049007416, 0.2524777948856354, 0.27361005544662476, 0.25452399253845215, 0.2504253387451172, 0.2567560076713562, 0.2541258931159973, 0.2511269152164459, 0.26615533232688904, 0.2530660033226013, 0.252015620470047, 0.26020053029060364, 0.2580175995826721, 0.25081512331962585, 0.25144386291503906, 0.25019702315330505, 0.2525840997695923, 0.2545873522758484, 0.25124433636665344, 0.25075674057006836, 0.2523852586746216, 0.2508379817008972, 0.2604421377182007, 0.25048431754112244, 0.25030696392059326, 0.25037622451782227, 0.2505326271057129, 0.2612539231777191, 0.25534629821777344, 0.2578713595867157, 0.25273236632347107, 0.25030985474586487, 0.26437273621559143, 0.2632564902305603, 0.2577331066131592]]"," and Analysis Center) that is supposed to keep track of and alert health care providers to cyberattacks.

3190,"China's central bank says fighting inflation will receive higher priority this year, raising the possibility of more rate hikes at a time when other major economies are trying to boost growth.
The announcement late Thursday follows repeated pledges by Beijing to cool inflation that jumped to a 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November. Communist leaders worry that sharp rises in living costs might trigger unrest.
""Stabilizing price levels will receive more prominent status,"" the People's Bank of China said in a report after an annual planning meeting. The bank said it will ""effectively manage liquidity and control financial conditions that might cause excessive price increases.""
Chinese stocks declined in early trading Friday after the announcement but the main index rebounded to positive territory by late morning.
The inflation surge highlights the contrast between China, which rebounded quickly from the global crisis and is trying to restore normal financial conditions, and the United States and struggling European economies.
Higher interest rates could further slow China's growth, possibly cutting its demand for factory machinery, industrial components, iron ore and other imports from the United States, Europe, Australia and its Asian neighbors.
China's rapid expansion slowed to"," 9.6 percent in the three months ending in September, down from 10.3 percent the previous quarter, though still the highest of any major economy. Analysts expect that to slow further this year as Beijing clamps down on credit and steers growth to a more sustainable level.
Analysts blame the price rises on the flood of bank lending that helped China ward off the global downturn. Inflation so far is limited mostly to food, but analysts say price pressures will spread unless Beijing raises interest rates further and tightens access to credit.
Inflation has been well above the government's target of 3 percent since late last year and some analysts expect it to rise further in December and January.
The central bank has raised interest rates twice in the past three months, most recently on Christmas Day. Many analysts expect more increases this year.
Chinese leaders ordered a shift in monetary policy from easy credit to a ""prudent monetary policy"" in 2011 in a planning report issued last month.",434,234,200,78.0742256641388,81.20159435272217,"[[0.6546364426612854, 0.3020279109477997, 0.5076928734779358, 0.8167157769203186, 0.400762677192688, 0.5303505063056946, 0.4927562177181244, 0.2828220725059509, 0.6591644287109375, 0.8983919024467468, 0.7209972143173218, 0.934626579284668, 0.5141621232032776, 0.9044322371482849, 0.6629543304443359, 0.6105917692184448, 0.8915798664093018, 0.4748760461807251, 0.6782000660896301, 0.768628716468811, 0.4172244668006897, 0.44343701004981995, 0.7375063896179199, 0.5290863513946533, 0.25262364745140076, 0.2573985159397125, 0.8041830658912659, 0.25328561663627625, 0.25289857387542725, 0.4688184857368469, 0.4334893226623535, 0.736055850982666, 0.8279049396514893, 0.25196710228919983, 0.8015381693840027, 0.7620615363121033, 0.7399853467941284, 0.3303323984146118, 0.274717777967453, 0.6414228081703186, 0.5334748029708862, 0.39912092685699463, 0.2943401038646698, 0.8229008913040161, 0.8353794813156128, 0.8496719002723694, 0.8203437924385071, 0.575830340385437, 0.29503482580184937, 0.26911661028862, 0.9089812636375427, 0.895209789276123, 0.30788683891296387, 0.9266469478607178, 0.6377437710762024, 0.4497079849243164, 0.9490314722061157, 0.5828822255134583, 0.8484569191932678, 0.7377389073371887, 0.3396179974079132, 0.8880664706230164, 0.33869361877441406, 0.6147357821464539, 0.2729048430919647, 0.786087155342102, 0.9097596406936646, 0.8607488870620728, 0.5102559328079224, 0.8268095850944519, 0.3359697163105011, 0.4011763632297516, 0.3187609910964966, 0.806541383266449, 0.7416460514068604, 0.7638843655586243, 0.9045903086662292, 0.566532552242279, 0.822811484336853, 0.5211670398712158, 0.49230265617370605, 0.5617885589599609, 0.42428359389305115, 0.45976191759109497, 0.26270195841789246, 0.736151397228241, 0.5353477001190186, 0.34689652919769287, 0.3813633620738983, 0.9046835899353027, 0.9250392913818359, 0.3916820287704468, 0.25863486528396606, 0.7959786653518677, 0.2508162558078766, 0.7520866394042969, 0.8480511903762817, 0.4216599464416504, 0.4919087290763855, 0.8707858324050903, 0.256176620721817, 0.8381158113479614, 0.3936832845211029, 0.917384922504425, 0.8704524040222168, 0.8982467651367188, 0.5161460041999817, 0.6016319990158081, 0.42059826850891113, 0.6046984195709229, 0.28234583139419556, 0.7077015042304993, 0.3218812048435211, 0.3927978575229645, 0.8227430582046509, 0.9004165530204773, 0.9381887316703796, 0.945685863494873, 0.2818608582019806, 0.8501933813095093, 0.8752003312110901, 0.7309118509292603, 0.528354823589325, 0.9375463724136353, 0.8173022866249084, 0.4778878092765808, 0.9324559569358826, 0.7811328768730164, 0.7075356841087341, 0.819961667060852, 0.44419416785240173, 0.3071634769439697, 0.26974400877952576, 0.26823532581329346, 0.31047743558883667, 0.2717360556125641, 0.2557694613933563, 0.25347667932510376, 0.2722768783569336, 0.29049915075302124, 0.2763032913208008, 0.2892095446586609, 0.25315728783607483, 0.25367796421051025, 0.25148314237594604, 0.29896482825279236, 0.26119452714920044, 0.25163403153419495, 0.2633534371852875, 0.33526068925857544, 0.4931178092956543, 0.4684354364871979, 0.538371205329895, 0.2522650361061096, 0.25960972905158997, 0.2555221617221832, 0.25269684195518494, 0.252580463886261, 0.25548362731933594, 0.25145021080970764, 0.26763829588890076, 0.252048134803772, 0.25106579065322876, 0.2504049241542816, 0.25119075179100037, 0.2502814829349518, 0.25158753991127014, 0.25080204010009766, 0.2505565285682678, 0.25048691034317017, 0.2546798884868622, 0.25089970231056213, 0.2502354681491852, 0.2573162615299225, 0.25051796436309814, 0.25518450140953064, 0.2513792812824249, 0.31845855712890625, 0.3596552312374115, 0.6618055701255798, 0.6291491389274597, 0.7745213508605957]]"," 7.9 percent last year, the weakest pace since 1990.

""Despite the recent pick-up in prices, underlying inflation is still low,"" the central bank said in its annual report.
Higher prices are a shock for Chinese families. They might prompt consumers to postpone or cancel plans to buy expensive items, such as cars, trains and items from cellphones to computers.
Inflation is a problem for the ruling Communist Party, which is trying to rein in debt and widen economic participation by encouraging more people to work, invest and do business.
The central bank pledged to ""further reduce the leverage ratio"" of banks, which gross domestic product is based on.

5360,"JUST a month after coming into power, the Zifa board have been rocked by a tsunami with vice-president Gift Banda being suspended yesterday following a meeting of the game's leaders held in the capital.
The Bulawayo-based football administrator, who was a runaway winner in the battle for the Zifa vice-presidency, was suspended for allegedly reshuffling the Warriors technical team without the blessing of his boss, Felton Kamambo, and other board members.
Banda, who was Zifa acting president when he announced that Rahman Gumbo and Lloyd Mutasa had been relieved of their duties and replaced by Bongani Mafu and Tonderai Ndiraya, was said to have acted beyond the jurisdiction of his authority.
In arguments presented to his fellow board members yesterday, Banda said he felt his role as the acting president empowered him to make such decisions.
He even suggested that if what he did was out of line with the constitution, then the board had the power to reverse the appointments and stick with the old Warriors technical set-up.
Kamambo was out of the country in Senegal for the Caf awards at the time.
The appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu had to be ratified at the Zifa board meeting which was held yesterday but things quickly took a nasty turn when Banda was asked to leave the room while other board members discussed the issue. While the board could have merely chosen not to ratify the appointments of Ndiraya and Mafu, if they felt they had not been done according to their constitution, they decided that punitive measures should be meted on the Zifa vice-president.
The matter was taken to a vote and four of the seven remaining members voted for Banda to be suspended, pending the confirmation of his suspension by the Zifa Council at the association's annual meeting in March, while three voted for him to be retained as the vice-president.
Ironically, Banda, who received 35 votes from Councillors in a strong showing in his successful battle to become the Zifa vice-president just a month ago, had"," his fate sealed by just four votes from his fellow board members.
Interestingly, a margin of one vote was all that mattered for him to be suspended from his post and he becomes the first Zifa vice-president to meet such a fate since Kenny Marange was also kicked out of the board by the leadership of Cuthbert Dube eight years ago.
It's the first time that a Zifa vice-president, the second most powerful man in the management of the game in the country, has been booted out after just one month.
Zifa boss Kamambo had, interestingly, told the domestic football family that his leadership will not suspend any of the board members because he felt such a system crippled the operations of the leadership of the game. However, things changed dramatically yesterday when Banda was shown the red card by his fellow board members just one month after coming into office.
Banda refused to comment on the developments yesterday saying he will release a comprehensive response in due course.",633,433,200,86.12851643562317,97.04358649253845,"[[0.9278333187103271, 0.8768255710601807, 0.6066753268241882, 0.5155714750289917, 0.913650631904602, 0.9699905514717102, 0.7970926761627197, 0.6298384070396423, 0.5740970373153687, 0.2502436339855194, 0.25007715821266174, 0.754812479019165, 0.369279146194458, 0.2762330174446106, 0.36460351943969727, 0.26749134063720703, 0.26268333196640015, 0.28038230538368225, 0.7711218595504761, 0.9163821339607239, 0.399636834859848, 0.2626892626285553, 0.26050686836242676, 0.9452816843986511, 0.7612882256507874, 0.4895545542240143, 0.8610916137695312, 0.5656964778900146, 0.6121581196784973, 0.6837961673736572, 0.6009195446968079, 0.957912802696228, 0.5589567422866821, 0.2506347894668579, 0.882753312587738, 0.8798415660858154, 0.5419365763664246, 0.7121132016181946, 0.8034211993217468, 0.8152133226394653, 0.6613883972167969, 0.6167261004447937, 0.35553428530693054, 0.729487419128418, 0.4487169682979584, 0.7996385097503662, 0.41185393929481506, 0.29162585735321045, 0.3687335252761841, 0.7725794315338135, 0.7273620963096619, 0.2589670419692993, 0.3878646790981293, 0.6528684496879578, 0.8369008898735046, 0.642733097076416, 0.6499801874160767, 0.5045784115791321, 0.638855516910553, 0.7201956510543823, 0.5465998649597168, 0.2506868243217468, 0.25040921568870544, 0.3987407088279724, 0.4218263030052185, 0.500754714012146, 0.336983323097229, 0.8493358492851257, 0.2885802090167999, 0.8689330816268921, 0.47565823793411255, 0.8992345929145813, 0.8494544625282288, 0.8468340039253235, 0.6006528735160828, 0.37887078523635864, 0.7482754588127136, 0.2776338756084442, 0.589666485786438, 0.7031129598617554, 0.5722659230232239, 0.3341899812221527, 0.6279808878898621, 0.3357672393321991, 0.5218331217765808, 0.9702722430229187, 0.5563978552818298, 0.6599153876304626, 0.8193276524543762, 0.30877935886383057, 0.6667250990867615, 0.2521023452281952, 0.899567723274231, 0.3221711218357086, 0.8064735531806946, 0.6880210638046265, 0.6402268409729004, 0.548239529132843, 0.4724912643432617, 0.7992734313011169, 0.9515933990478516, 0.42516905069351196, 0.8986161947250366, 0.25891581177711487, 0.6710519790649414, 0.48663410544395447, 0.6024459600448608, 0.6192644834518433, 0.8093964457511902, 0.8632984161376953, 0.7463469505310059, 0.3127810060977936, 0.8143911361694336, 0.8439385890960693, 0.499117910861969, 0.32762372493743896, 0.9039191007614136, 0.40794867277145386, 0.6670935153961182, 0.30056634545326233, 0.5001114010810852, 0.2524602711200714, 0.7363021373748779, 0.7294549942016602, 0.8594428300857544, 0.6796786189079285, 0.4020734429359436, 0.9141535758972168, 0.5367575883865356, 0.9402579069137573, 0.5675237774848938, 0.7176530361175537, 0.9159955978393555, 0.9587813019752502, 0.2966678738594055, 0.6793608069419861, 0.9643000364303589, 0.7548439502716064, 0.6412924528121948, 0.5730301737785339, 0.39242082834243774, 0.88521808385849, 0.7875794172286987, 0.2800200879573822, 0.7838500142097473, 0.5068171620368958, 0.5835112929344177, 0.25209110975265503, 0.8742724061012268, 0.9199196100234985, 0.9401569962501526, 0.5907886028289795, 0.3868303894996643, 0.5853485465049744, 0.25036484003067017, 0.896730363368988, 0.6861074566841125, 0.5491119027137756, 0.9816070795059204, 0.759994626045227, 0.47122836112976074, 0.8100724220275879, 0.2646516263484955, 0.9595778584480286, 0.7385025024414062, 0.6074829697608948, 0.2514287233352661, 0.8805221915245056, 0.9360665678977966, 0.725638210773468, 0.9318863153457642, 0.7720863223075867, 0.5440541505813599, 0.8828189373016357, 0.4053488075733185, 0.38712871074676514, 0.25078266859054565, 0.8853146433830261, 0.9212769269943237, 0.8092061877250671, 0.92812579870224, 0.8054779767990112, 0.7382929921150208, 0.750758707523346, 0.7923609018325806, 0.6151758432388306, 0.9685853719711304, 0.37610864639282227, 0.8654317855834961, 0.7054694890975952, 0.9505513906478882, 0.858496904373169, 0.9359877705574036, 0.8631998896598816, 0.2863035798072815, 0.3699483275413513, 0.25028151273727417, 0.8347969055175781, 0.6561490893363953, 0.8836443424224854]]"," been weak in his argument that he had the power to appoint the team's technical committee.

To quote Sunshine Anderson, we've ""heard it all before.""
After years of talk and no delivery, nobody should be surprised that Arista has announced it will push back the in-store date for Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes' solo debut, Supernova, from summer to fall.
However, the self-proclaimed ""crazy"" of TLC said she'll have her music out to the people on August 16 by hook or by crook.
""I picked the 16th as the release date because something weird happened in my family,"" she explained. ""My father died and his father was born on August 16. And January 31 was the day that he was born and his father died. So they came in and out on each other's dates, and they were both 40 when they died.""
Left Eye is so adamant about the album coming out next week that she said she'll stream the album's 13 tracks on her Web site (www.eyenetics.com) starting at 12:01 a.m. on that fateful day. She's getting support from the label online; an Arista spokesperson said the tracks will also be streamed on parent company BMG's click2music.com.
""It's a very significant release date for me,"" Left Eye said. ""It was something that has been sitting in the back of my mind for a couple of years now like, 'Wow, I wonder what that means?' There's magic in those numbers for me, because 162001 equals 10, which in numerology is symbolic of a star, and the album is called Supernova. It all ties in. It's a conceptual thing but there's a deep meaning buried in it. Everything has a double meaning.""
A fair share of stars guest on the album. Look for appearances by Carl Thomas, Esthero, Blaque and Tupac Shakur.
""The track with Tupac is titled 'Untouchable,' and it speaks for itself,"" Left Eye said. ""Tupac and everything about him is untouchable to me. I didn't record the song with him. I got a copy of the song and his lyrics were on the track. If you want to talk about whether I recorded it before or after his death, I can't answer that. It's still a mystery to me.""
Left Eye said she asks about the mysteries of life, and the mysteries of Pac's life, on the track.
""I'm basically asking him to answer those questions for me,"" she said. ""In the third verse he gives me his view from the other side. Some of the song's lyrics are so heavy. He says things like, 'You remember me legendary, I live eternally.' He produced the song. It's dynamite to me because he isn't"," known as a producer. It's like a double whammy because I get a song produced by Tupac  a song featuring him that actually features me. I'm featured on a Tupac song on my album.""
As to why Arista has decided to push back the album's release after confirming it would be out on August 14 a month ago (see ""Left Eye Delivering Solo Supernova... Finally""), a label spokesperson said Arista wanted Left Eye to record more tracks for the album as well as lay vocals for the new TLC disc. The spokesperson added that Lopes would promote her album overseas during breaks in recording between now and October.
The first video from Supernova is the Hype Williams-directed ""Block Party,"" which should air any day. The video depicts Left Eye dancing with children on a computer-generated neighborhood block.
All three members of TLC are in the studio, and Arista said their album should come out before the end of the year.",793,593,200,92.8601005077362,103.81964087486267,"[[0.8954629898071289, 0.7682576179504395, 0.8052327632904053, 0.668866753578186, 0.3312320411205292, 0.4659287631511688, 0.7565220594406128, 0.2778545022010803, 0.5385441184043884, 0.8295822739601135, 0.6773087978363037, 0.8447918891906738, 0.8540180921554565, 0.5185400247573853, 0.5668274760246277, 0.3755597472190857, 0.5789691209793091, 0.7169280052185059, 0.745086133480072, 0.5420084595680237, 0.4831317067146301, 0.6926880478858948, 0.7737594246864319, 0.6592082381248474, 0.5218465328216553, 0.6589990258216858, 0.2999504506587982, 0.547860860824585, 0.49168145656585693, 0.7291173338890076, 0.633642315864563, 0.6183352470397949, 0.3239842653274536, 0.59652179479599, 0.2766987979412079, 0.492204487323761, 0.8177530765533447, 0.5012457966804504, 0.39178046584129333, 0.5968507528305054, 0.8381009697914124, 0.5341747403144836, 0.8643160462379456, 0.6236339211463928, 0.719676673412323, 0.5878469347953796, 0.5334542989730835, 0.5565175414085388, 0.5069609880447388, 0.5336434841156006, 0.5035420656204224, 0.5112102031707764, 0.48193275928497314, 0.4850613474845886, 0.4272843301296234, 0.462604820728302, 0.38131222128868103, 0.43889185786247253, 0.33969369530677795, 0.4195461869239807, 0.30890953540802, 0.40739500522613525, 0.2895295321941376, 0.3914111256599426, 0.2794879078865051, 0.3799169659614563, 0.27459007501602173, 0.3691275715827942, 0.2710605263710022, 0.3595958948135376, 0.26836958527565, 0.352871298789978, 0.26664045453071594, 0.34562957286834717, 0.26558229327201843, 0.3391754627227783, 0.26521915197372437, 0.3339039385318756, 0.2646705210208893, 0.3285883665084839, 0.26428771018981934, 0.3242264986038208, 0.26402387022972107, 0.3209342062473297, 0.26404815912246704, 0.3160936236381531, 0.26345089077949524, 0.31363558769226074, 0.2634328305721283, 0.31094884872436523, 0.26374155282974243, 0.3084142804145813, 0.2633841037750244, 0.3064035475254059, 0.263338178396225, 0.3054305613040924, 0.2633376717567444, 0.3037298619747162, 0.26334917545318604, 0.3012191653251648, 0.2629845440387726, 0.30008378624916077, 0.2632307708263397, 0.2988734245300293, 0.26293933391571045, 0.2970265746116638, 0.2624177634716034, 0.2964250445365906, 0.26194632053375244, 0.2946602702140808, 0.2615571618080139, 0.29217076301574707, 0.2611427903175354, 0.29218319058418274, 0.2610887289047241, 0.2902838885784149, 0.26056408882141113, 0.2884136736392975, 0.2603512704372406, 0.2866568863391876, 0.26025113463401794, 0.28512832522392273, 0.2602170407772064, 0.28442537784576416, 0.2603335976600647, 0.2829381227493286, 0.260203093290329, 0.2828066349029541, 0.2599167823791504, 0.282537579536438, 0.2597613036632538, 0.28209298849105835, 0.25947198271751404, 0.2822227478027344, 0.25907662510871887, 0.2818286418914795, 0.25887829065322876, 0.2816287577152252, 0.25862768292427063, 0.2818203866481781, 0.25850892066955566, 0.2818162441253662, 0.25829097628593445, 0.2806142270565033, 0.2582783102989197, 0.2794114649295807, 0.2583962678909302, 0.2787562608718872, 0.2584439516067505, 0.27834442257881165, 0.25853124260902405, 0.2771477699279785, 0.25843486189842224, 0.277073472738266, 0.25866419076919556, 0.2762739658355713, 0.2587974965572357, 0.2759695053100586, 0.2587789297103882, 0.27618303894996643, 0.258772611618042, 0.2749940752983093, 0.25916317105293274, 0.27497851848602295, 0.25955909490585327, 0.2744431495666504, 0.26027271151542664, 0.27282264828681946, 0.2605547606945038, 0.27236393094062805, 0.2613333761692047, 0.27102532982826233, 0.2617862820625305, 0.27045172452926636, 0.2620733380317688, 0.2692924439907074, 0.262710839509964, 0.2685278356075287, 0.26315760612487793, 0.2674797773361206, 0.2638923227787018, 0.2669169008731842, 0.26453524827957153, 0.26650652289390564, 0.2647373676300049, 0.2654567360877991, 0.2654094398021698, 0.2653316855430603, 0.26544639468193054, 0.2653377056121826, 0.2658061683177948, 0.2649710476398468, 0.2662831246852875, 0.26455771923065186, 0.2666698098182678, 0.2637692987918854, 0.2676165997982025, 0.2630392909049988, 0.26852715015411377, 0.26278039813041687]]"," in me.

""I'm so excited about that song,"" she said. ""It's such a cute song. A lot of people know the Fireball XM single 'Beautiful People' as the TLC song, but I think the Fireball XM radio single is a song that everyone knows.""
She added that the song made her feel like a princess.
""That song is so beautiful,"" she said. ""It's so sweet. It's a sexy song for me, but there's more than one way to skin a cat. I like the way it sounds, but there's more to it. It's got a cool beat and there's a lot of energy in it. I'm really excited about the cover.""

Nice robot, love it thanks rencontres par webcam.

The expressions are also very close to human speech patterns.
While the robot’s expressions are very close to human speech patterns, they are also extremely complex.

It takes a lot of effort to form these complex expressions, and even more to control them.

Conceptually, the robot can express emotions in a number of ways, but it would be difficult to translate these into spoken language.
The robot is also very sensitive to its environment, and has a keen sense of smell.

2417,"In a 53-page document filed quietly last week with environmental regulators and made public Tuesday, sweeping changes are detailed in the state’s highway tolling infrastructure and policies – including a program to charge tolls on the Tobin Bridge for northbound and southbound traffic.
The document – published in the insider-only ‘Environmental Monitor’ – details the new All-Electronic Tolling System (AETS) implementation project, a project addressed in some measure through meetings held in Chelsea and other municipalities earlier this summer. It’s a project Gov. Deval Patrick has pushed since day one, eliminating cash toll collection booths and going to an all-electronic system. It would be the largest toll road electronic conversion project in the nation to date, if approved.
While the document made public this week is concerned mostly with environmental aspects of the project, many key details in the tolling plan emerged concerning the Tobin Bridge and harbor tunnels (Ted Williams, Callahan, Sumner and I-90 Boston Extension).
One of the major changes for the Tobin and harbor tunnels includes adding tolling locations for northbound traffic. Currently, all northbound traffic out of Boston on the Bridge and tunnels pays no toll. Under the new plan, AETS gateways would be added for northbound and southbound traffic – meaning that a person going into Boston from Chelsea or other points north would be charged going in and coming out.
There was no word in the document about whether Chelsea’s host community discount would continue for the Bridge, which would be a key question for those living in Chelsea. That said, state transportation officials have certainly had their sights set on eliminating such discounts systemwide for the last several years. That, however, will be a conversation for a different day and likely something that local leaders will have to fight for.
The toll booths on the Tobin would be demolished under the plan, and new AETS gateways would be stretched over the southbound roadway after the Bridge and just before the exit splits (Rutherford Ave. or 93 South) in Charlestown.
Later, a northbound tolling gateway is proposed to stretch across the northbound roadway just prior to the entrance to the Bridge tunnel, also in Charlestown.
The southbound Tobin AETS gateway would actually end up being the Pilot Program for the new technology – being implemented next year as a test for the systemwide change that is proposed for 2015.
The system would work via the EZ Pass electronic collection method that many already use. Statistics in the filing showed that 68 percent of tolls at the Bridge and harbor tunnels in 2012 were collected via the EZ Pass. For those who do not or cannot convert to the EZ Pass system, photos of a person’s license plate will be taken at each toll gateway and an invoice will be sent on a monthly basis to the owner of that plate. The state has already worked out a system of enforcement with other states to collect unpaid tolls from out-of-state placeholders. Similarly, those in-state placeholders who do not pay the invoices would be subject to fines and Registry withholdings.
For those in Chelsea who use the Ted Williams Tunnel or the Callahan Tunnel, there would be a major change and with no possible savings via the host discount. The northbound Callahan Tunnel and the northbound side of the Ted Williams Tunnel also will begin charging a toll – a movement that is now free as tolls are only charged for those coming into Boston.
“The Metropolitan Highway System (MHS) Williams Tunnel currently collects tolls in two nearby westbound (inbound) plazas by Logan Airport,” read the filing. “These structures will be retained, but cash collection booths and equipment will be removed. Also, this tunnel will be converted from one-way to two-way tolling, with the addition of an AETS toll zone for eastbound traffic. Rates will be modified to reflect the change in tolls by collection in both directions.
While the filing indicated modified rates for only the Williams Tunnel due to two-way tolling, it did not specify what kind of rate modification, and it mentioned no rate modifications for two-way tolling at the Tobin Bridge and Sumner/Callahan crossings.
All in"," all, 18 new gated toll locations would be added to the system to accompany the existing 24 locations.
While most of the locations are in Western and Central Massachusetts on the Mass Pike and are designed to reduce traffic congestion and the “ticket” toll system, the moves on the Boston Pike Extension and the Bridge/Harbor Tunnels would be huge changes.
Many local and state officials had no idea of the dramatic changes detailed in the filing until told by the newspaper, and all deferred comment until they could find out more information on the extensive plan.
Key members in the Legislature, however, tended to think the DOT was taking the half-a-loaf approach – asking for the full loaf in hopes of getting a half-loaf or even just a slice of bread.
Such changes can be implemented without Legislative approval – requiring only that Commissioners approve it. However, such a change would cost millions and that kind of appropriation would need to be approved by the State Legislature.",1086,886,200,105.84873223304749,116.6724305152893,"[[0.3418591618537903, 0.40245893597602844, 0.8255289793014526, 0.26544031500816345, 0.550792932510376, 0.7568187713623047, 0.6124386787414551, 0.442997008562088, 0.40853214263916016, 0.8799942135810852, 0.6882867813110352, 0.6017156839370728, 0.7276866436004639, 0.8223109841346741, 0.8790165781974792, 0.9309967756271362, 0.6116973161697388, 0.8305420279502869, 0.8050410747528076, 0.522947371006012, 0.637803852558136, 0.8673787117004395, 0.7760710716247559, 0.8360486626625061, 0.590506911277771, 0.6721392869949341, 0.6926849484443665, 0.7432976961135864, 0.6489312052726746, 0.7174018621444702, 0.749413013458252, 0.53852778673172, 0.5453648567199707, 0.7647383213043213, 0.25708043575286865, 0.7652892470359802, 0.6415038108825684, 0.41779592633247375, 0.9213035106658936, 0.7923780679702759, 0.8232136964797974, 0.6890277862548828, 0.8868995904922485, 0.708968460559845, 0.5713858604431152, 0.9351532459259033, 0.7500892281532288, 0.9161872267723083, 0.7656287550926208, 0.7941007614135742, 0.9507894515991211, 0.46139827370643616, 0.7207471132278442, 0.8981610536575317, 0.3573448061943054, 0.43776974081993103, 0.3205571174621582, 0.822971761226654, 0.40823623538017273, 0.7972238659858704, 0.49555981159210205, 0.663448691368103, 0.9616931676864624, 0.2538268268108368, 0.6124650239944458, 0.4005002975463867, 0.917205810546875, 0.3254033625125885, 0.8345751762390137, 0.7360256314277649, 0.598209798336029, 0.44940775632858276, 0.8583546876907349, 0.2852468490600586, 0.8084551095962524, 0.8306054472923279, 0.7003884315490723, 0.8668016195297241, 0.8407739996910095, 0.5468363165855408, 0.262616902589798, 0.8044618964195251, 0.36219996213912964, 0.5730220675468445, 0.7650939226150513, 0.8025526404380798, 0.7782689929008484, 0.5203273892402649, 0.8852078914642334, 0.44789427518844604, 0.6724818348884583, 0.7867962718009949, 0.7228661775588989, 0.8579596877098083, 0.4213467240333557, 0.4009675681591034, 0.8208519220352173, 0.7877199649810791, 0.5074443221092224, 0.5026335120201111, 0.26739007234573364, 0.7404255867004395, 0.8993194103240967, 0.8187193870544434, 0.8398101329803467, 0.5594345927238464, 0.949992299079895, 0.8787007927894592, 0.9546967148780823, 0.8794721961021423, 0.6758669018745422, 0.8653189539909363, 0.9616430997848511, 0.882089376449585, 0.7765755653381348, 0.8735615015029907, 0.5701002478599548, 0.6842469573020935, 0.8314113616943359, 0.6088418960571289, 0.8369295001029968, 0.8570836186408997, 0.7408965229988098, 0.6476481556892395, 0.8639749884605408, 0.7386714816093445, 0.5647304058074951, 0.6231158971786499, 0.8434324860572815, 0.6532018184661865, 0.9040173292160034, 0.6947135925292969, 0.8177814483642578, 0.318217396736145, 0.8737490773200989, 0.41641783714294434, 0.505423367023468, 0.3862384557723999, 0.7241843938827515, 0.917519211769104, 0.6517906188964844, 0.8113194108009338, 0.7125135660171509, 0.504654049873352, 0.8596311807632446, 0.8261513113975525, 0.7120421528816223, 0.47882330417633057, 0.8838139176368713, 0.4314221441745758, 0.6835957765579224, 0.9472487568855286, 0.4804690480232239, 0.783877432346344, 0.4198349416255951, 0.38501447439193726, 0.794148325920105, 0.31525659561157227, 0.5021597146987915, 0.5635653138160706, 0.5537824034690857, 0.7007046937942505, 0.4157291352748871, 0.4502300024032593, 0.47042590379714966, 0.5704653263092041, 0.875337541103363, 0.2643416225910187, 0.29376742243766785, 0.28516826033592224, 0.2931990921497345, 0.3740822672843933, 0.46520838141441345, 0.40873515605926514, 0.297292023897171, 0.2529543936252594, 0.3680613934993744, 0.38685083389282227, 0.4670904278755188, 0.3536452054977417, 0.3106658458709717, 0.2664743661880493, 0.31569787859916687, 0.26304906606674194, 0.2566334903240204, 0.30100584030151367, 0.3355550765991211, 0.35767862200737, 0.26902052760124207, 0.26461851596832275, 0.2576504051685333, 0.30451974272727966, 0.4531198740005493, 0.347486674785614, 0.250900536775589, 0.25066789984703064, 0.2518749237060547, 0.2531890273094177, 0.26950788497924805, 0.42926666140556335]]"," all, the proposal is a major step for the state’s transportation infrastructure.
The change will be phased in over the next two years, with the first change likely to take place in 2015. The final change, which will end cash toll collection from the Bridge for northbound traffic, would take place in 2017.
The plan also includes a commuter rail option for any future changes to the system, a move that is expected to be approved by the state’s Executive Council.
The MTA is still planning to build a third track into the Tobin and harbor tunnels, and that track will be added in the 2015 phase. There are also plans to make the tunnels more accessible for non-motorized vehicles, while scarce space would be made available for pedestrian and bicycle access on the bridges.
As previously reported in this space, the state is also considering an extension of the South Station station development. As envisioned, the $1.5 billion extension of the South Station project","-road tooll rates would continue to be at current prices, so that Chelsea and Chelsea Crossing commuters and commuters from South Station would stay on course to continue to be able to take out the regular state toll lane along State Highway 16 and exit to the south at a rate between 0-5.5. The south entrance to the South End would retain it current one exit and five lane toll. However the to the south tollway to the South End would retain a six lane tollway to the South End – in a move to avoid a lane-mapped merge that some in Connecticut may fear would cause major trouble to commuters using Mass DOT Route 9 between Springfield to New York City via the CT-PA-NH Highway 2 Bridge of Record as a shortcut to New Jersey or New City via Springfield to New York City via the CT-PA-NH Highway 9 Bridge of Record as a shortcut to New Jersey or New City via Springfield to New York City via the CT-PA-NH Highway 2",200,200,0.5292436611652375,0.5833621525764465,"{'num_tokens_scored': 156, 'num_green_tokens': 153, 'green_fraction': 0.9807692307692307, 'z_score': 21.078607456558704, 'p_value': 6.2503826816000315e-99, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

7860,"Chattanooga Railway. In a city famous for its ``choo choos,'' the Lookout Mountain Incline Railway is billed as the world's steepest. Back in the 1880s, a group of Chattanooga businessmen built an elaborate hotel just below a famous point on Lookout Mountain. To convey guests to the hotel, they built a narrow-guage railway up the side of the mountain. Today the hotel is long gone, but the railway remains, and it gives passengers the chance to see one of Tennessee's most impressive views.

Nearly 2,000 Americans were turned away at French borders this year for not having visas. To enter France, you must get a visa - a stamp in your passport showing it has been examined by the proper officals of that country - before you go. You'll need a valid passport, $15, one passport-sized photo of yourself, and an application form completed and signed. Visas are issued on the spot if you apply in person; by mail it takes up to three weeks. A visa is valid for three years and permits you to stay up to 90 days at a time. For application and instructions, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the French Consulate in your region or to the French Embassy, 4101 Reservoir Rd. N.W., Washington, DC 20007.
Memorize your passport number. You'll need it when you cash a traveler's check, fill out a customs form, or register at a hotel.
Take a sweater. Even if you're traveling in a tropical hot spot, an air-conditioned bus or restaurant may be uncomfortably chilly.
Don't automatically change your dollars to local currency. Many cities will take those dollars, and it saves constant switching back and forth to new money.
Take an umbrella. Hopefully it won't rain. If you're touring by bus, rack it there.
Use a camera that offers control over flash. You'll get more pictures. Often it's the flash, not the picture taking, that's objectionable.
Coordinate your watch with your guide's. If you don't, and your watch is slow, you may get left behind.

3185,"The third season of Sons of Anarchy saw the motorcycle gang travel to Ireland and back, and ended with many of them going to prison. But while Jax (Charlie Hunnam) and Clay (Ron Perlman) patch up their relationship in jail, Tara finds out that Jax's deceased father and former leader of the motorcycle club feared that he would be killed by Clay and Gemma. We asked SOA creator Kurt Sutter about where he wants to take the fourth season, and when viewers can expect the crap to hit the fan.
TV Guide Magazine: What was the feedback you got for the third season?
Sutter: It's been primarily good. It's always a risk when you take your guys out of their main environment and I think when we went to Ireland people started wondering what that was about, but I think once we started to reveal the mythology about why we were going to Ireland and the weight of that on Jax. I saw that one of the sites was picking their favorite season and oddly enough Season 3 was up by three or four percent over season 2. So overall I think there was something fascinating about the scope of it, and going out of their environment. I love revealing the mythology, I love the whole IRA connection and the thematic weight of that. I'm a history guy, so there's a part of me that was digging on that.
TV Guide Magazine: Where do you see the fourth season going? Do you see more focus being placed on what happened to John?
Sutter: I think that always looms out there for Jax and I think the information he got this season will continue to impact him. But I think Season 4 will really be about dealing with the ramifications of all that new information, and it's a different Charming that they're coming back to. It's a different gun business for them. The 21st Century really starts to creep into the town and into the club.
TV Guide Magazine: What does that mean, specifically?
Sutter: I think ultimately there's a lot more progress in the town with Hale now becoming mayor there'll be a lot more development in the town. All the things they've been trying to avoid for years will ultimately start to creep in. If they can't keep Charming contained anymore, how do they deal with that?
TV Guide Magazine: Are you tempted to make it more about Clay and Jax and Gemma?
Sutter: I think ultimately, it is about the three of them and everything sort of is either background or devices to complicate all those relationships. I think Clay has a personal connection with Charming and there's something about the karmic weight of if he can keep that"," town small and safe, everything else we do is OK. So I think it's important for Clay to maintain that relationship with Charming. So it will be interesting to see how he deals with that this season.
TV Guide Magazine: I assume there will be another confrontation between Clay and Jax at some point.
Sutter: At some point. I think it's interesting that we opened those wounds up in Season 2 and then let them heal over in Season 3. I think one of the most powerful moments of the season for people was in the finale when Clay says to jax, 'I love you, son.' In contrast to what was going on last season, and I think there's almost a greater sense of betrayal when those wounds heal over and you ultimately rip the scab off again.

7934,"NEWARK – Filling out his Winnipeg Jets lineup card has probably never been tougher for head coach Paul Maurice than it is right now.
That job only figures to become more challenging later this month with the expected return of defenceman Jacob Trouba and centre Adam Lowry from injury.
As the Jets get face to face the New York Rangers on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, Maurice isn’t planning to make any lineup changes after his team has posted consecutive victories to improve to 39-17-9 on the season.
Jets forward Brandon Tanev missed 10 consecutive games with an upper-body injury, but is expected to be a healthy scratch for the second contest in a row.
Just how does Maurice strike the balance between not wanting to change things up and finding room for a player that was an effective player for the Jets prior to the injury?
“That is a really good question and I’m working on that,” Maurice said after the Jets skated at the New Jersey Devils practice rink on Monday afternoon. “Fairly soon, if everything plays out, we’re going to have four extra healthy forwards that have all played for us.
Starting with training camp, the competition to both stay in the lineup and earn more ice time began in earnest.
But as injuries and opportunities occurred over the course of the season, youngsters like Kyle Connor and later Jack Roslovic have not just established themselves as regulars – they’re making an important contribution on the top two lines.
Connor is actually third on the Jets in goals (22) and sixth in points (41), which is even more impressive when you consider he started in the AHL and missed the first six games.
The addition of veteran centre Paul Stastny gave the Jets even more strength down the middle.
And after starting the campaign with what was basically a top-six and bottom-six forward group, the Jets have evolved into a team that features three scoring lines and a checking line, albeit one that can also chip in offensively.
Having that type of depth is a luxury the Jets haven’t really enjoyed during the six previous seasons.
It makes them a dangerous group to contend with and opposition coaches are being forced to make tough choices when it comes to which line to play the top defence pairing against.
Do you load up and try to contain Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler or do you send the shutdown group out against Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers?
And don’t forget about veterans like Little and Mathieu Perreault.
It essentially becomes a bit of a pick your poison situation.
Internal competition can be a driving force and bring out the best in players.
It can also make life difficult for those on the outside looking in – especially for guys who had been carving out a role like Tanev, as a penalty killer who uses his speed to create havoc on the forecheck.
The goal for every team is to win,"," but those clubs who are often the most successful find a way to make the necessary personal sacrifices while working hard enough to be ready whenever their number is called.
Winning often makes being a healthy scratch a bit more palatable, even though it’s never easy to accept.
“If you’re out of the lineup, obviously you want to be and be playing and be a part of it but for a team, it’s a good thing to have,” said Little. “The depth is so deep that you have good players out of your lineup and good players that are fighting for ice time and trying to get in. We can someone up and they’re NHL ready right off the bat and we’ve got guys fighting for spots in the lineup. We still have guys on the (Manitoba) Moose right now that aren’t even here that can probably step in pretty soon and be a player on this team.",814,614,200,93.53789448738098,104.53418159484863,"[[0.6247581243515015, 0.5242375135421753, 0.7462723255157471, 0.6996296644210815, 0.5929403305053711, 0.9202036261558533, 0.6287298798561096, 0.37967362999916077, 0.4071063697338104, 0.3126465976238251, 0.607443630695343, 0.7567628026008606, 0.5805169939994812, 0.6496110558509827, 0.588161051273346, 0.4216783940792084, 0.41715672612190247, 0.619787871837616, 0.27511173486709595, 0.5224910378456116, 0.6631006002426147, 0.9559160470962524, 0.5758493542671204, 0.4676988124847412, 0.3878474235534668, 0.4010659456253052, 0.8061236143112183, 0.5133714079856873, 0.32927942276000977, 0.8660373091697693, 0.7142419815063477, 0.635515034198761, 0.25991231203079224, 0.5878421068191528, 0.7883961796760559, 0.6533821225166321, 0.8827513456344604, 0.6144440770149231, 0.8159675002098083, 0.8642553687095642, 0.819718599319458, 0.3182850480079651, 0.8236150741577148, 0.467773973941803, 0.46956688165664673, 0.6203250885009766, 0.4634576141834259, 0.8634428381919861, 0.6433579921722412, 0.2690509259700775, 0.7614836692810059, 0.49618589878082275, 0.400724321603775, 0.6101990938186646, 0.5698164701461792, 0.3203529119491577, 0.45280444622039795, 0.31842759251594543, 0.8331334590911865, 0.3181479275226593, 0.28765833377838135, 0.9287940263748169, 0.606589138507843, 0.7385745644569397, 0.8888615369796753, 0.8870557546615601, 0.6708396673202515, 0.43442559242248535, 0.3982851505279541, 0.6039484143257141, 0.2710283696651459, 0.5350995659828186, 0.3336150050163269, 0.5271349549293518, 0.2592940330505371, 0.28150475025177, 0.6787659525871277, 0.48233941197395325, 0.2662225663661957, 0.5196041464805603, 0.46410924196243286, 0.4421226382255554, 0.2542113959789276, 0.3337821364402771, 0.3292646110057831, 0.36767226457595825, 0.2606062889099121, 0.4396324157714844, 0.29805177450180054, 0.43203192949295044, 0.25357574224472046, 0.48996853828430176, 0.26385393738746643, 0.2603989243507385, 0.25396203994750977, 0.30254825949668884, 0.2639434039592743, 0.35958191752433777, 0.25469356775283813, 0.4083082377910614, 0.2529325485229492, 0.25205135345458984, 0.2518070936203003, 0.2653888463973999, 0.2583830654621124, 0.37815776467323303, 0.25134459137916565, 0.3057354986667633, 0.25157463550567627, 0.250751256942749, 0.25101202726364136, 0.25593695044517517, 0.2547697126865387, 0.36293545365333557, 0.2513367235660553, 0.2801227271556854, 0.25093814730644226, 0.2504250407218933, 0.2506679594516754, 0.25313085317611694, 0.2531448304653168, 0.3765539526939392, 0.2505573332309723, 0.26599591970443726, 0.25092121958732605, 0.2503490447998047, 0.2505185306072235, 0.25202274322509766, 0.2522154748439789, 0.3707084059715271, 0.2504245638847351, 0.2630491852760315, 0.25103917717933655, 0.25029677152633667, 0.2504614293575287, 0.25146785378456116, 0.2517562508583069, 0.3317365348339081, 0.25042763352394104, 0.26103222370147705, 0.25119686126708984, 0.2502782344818115, 0.25043201446533203, 0.25121375918388367, 0.25148195028305054, 0.28261831402778625, 0.2504977285861969, 0.25998589396476746, 0.2513236999511719, 0.2502763867378235, 0.2504083216190338, 0.2511073052883148, 0.25132280588150024, 0.2657257318496704, 0.2505088746547699, 0.25904110074043274, 0.2512739300727844, 0.25026416778564453, 0.2503688335418701, 0.2509910464286804, 0.2511996030807495, 0.2602773606777191, 0.2505249083042145, 0.25880807638168335, 0.2512364983558655, 0.2502579689025879, 0.2503361999988556, 0.2508743703365326, 0.25106969475746155, 0.2577938139438629, 0.2505068778991699, 0.25867798924446106, 0.25114256143569946, 0.2502410113811493, 0.250312864780426, 0.25078240036964417, 0.2510294020175934, 0.25679031014442444, 0.2504833936691284, 0.2587730586528778, 0.2510908842086792, 0.2502390444278717, 0.2503020465373993, 0.25076577067375183, 0.2510206997394562, 0.2566261887550354, 0.25045084953308105, 0.25926458835601807, 0.25106072425842285, 0.2502339780330658, 0.2502889633178711, 0.2507815659046173, 0.2509362995624542, 0.25636956095695496, 0.25046440958976746, 0.25939133763313293, 0.2509547472000122, 0.2502310276031494, 0.250264972448349, 0.250800222158432]]"," but it’s easier said than done.
The Jets have done a good job of that this season, though.
“It’s a tough time to be out of the lineup and to not be playing, but it’s also a very good time when you have your teammates there to help you get back in the game,” Maurice said.
“That’s something we’ve seen on the ice since I’ve been here.
“We have had some guys that come back from injury, played really well and then they go back to playing on the fourth line and then they’re playing on the third and fourth line and then we have some guys that come back from injury and then we have a couple of guys that stay out and don’t play.
“And then it’s the same thing all over again.”
The Jets have been fortunate to not have any major", including opponents and opponents are doing just exactly just how it should be done against these five. The results are there to show it is possible too — three points out of the three points against is a better number to start your season on then seven out the seven against to start your season on a positive note while your record is a negative number to start your season on a negative note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a negative note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a negative note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on a positive note to start your season on,200,200,0.4676894724369049,0.5226709079742432,"{'num_tokens_scored': 71, 'num_green_tokens': 71, 'green_fraction': 1.0, 'z_score': 14.594519519326425, 'p_value': 1.521746792345074e-48, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

9583,"The Bears already made one major move to strengthen the offensive line when they signed left tackle Jermon Bushrod. This will create competition at right tackle, as Gabe Carimi and J'Marcus Webb will each push to earn the starting job. But the Bears still need to think about guards, and that's one area they can address with the draft.
Chance Warmack from Alabama is one of the best options for the Bears out of the draft. As a 6-foot-2, 317-lb. guard, he could fill holes in the Bears' interior line. He is known as a"," powerful run blocker, which would make Matt Forte quite happy.
The National Football Post says he has a nasty edge to his game, which the Bears line has been lacking since Olin Kreutz left the team. Part of keeping the quarterback safe means punishing the defenders who dare lay a hand on him. Warmack has the game to make it happen.
And it's not a bad idea for the Bears to bring in young, fresh talent on the interior. Lance Louis is a free agent who is coming off an ACL tear, and he still may not return. Roberto Garza just turned 34, and Chris Spencer and James Brown aren't as reliable the Bears need them to be.
Plus, that name! Think of all the headlines we can come up with the name Chance Warmack. It's a great, great football name that would fit well on the back of a Bears jersey. If he's available when the Bears pick at 20, Warmack would make sense for Chicago.",321,121,200,73.58216834068298,84.500324010849,"[[0.9146650433540344, 0.6208153367042542, 0.49816399812698364, 0.6172882914543152, 0.6573266386985779, 0.6574025750160217, 0.9567285180091858, 0.44619178771972656, 0.8245692253112793, 0.6495746374130249, 0.6667453050613403, 0.44913968443870544, 0.6626975536346436, 0.7996668815612793, 0.8565967082977295, 0.6297993659973145, 0.6886242628097534, 0.8150305151939392, 0.5897361636161804, 0.2530996799468994, 0.7659294009208679, 0.44046011567115784, 0.9628396034240723, 0.2827037572860718, 0.3451019823551178, 0.683021605014801, 0.4605938792228699, 0.3656194508075714, 0.4074069857597351, 0.2653294801712036, 0.7638487219810486, 0.25009337067604065, 0.8154188990592957, 0.7989392876625061, 0.4125496447086334, 0.581099271774292, 0.7608250975608826, 0.28705161809921265, 0.416088342666626, 0.2682197690010071, 0.26477569341659546, 0.8868414759635925, 0.6563796401023865, 0.2501060664653778, 0.9044334292411804, 0.8464589715003967, 0.9372645020484924, 0.7011800408363342, 0.5080183744430542, 0.25087082386016846, 0.8013619780540466, 0.8655775189399719, 0.939262866973877, 0.3035869002342224, 0.8162109851837158, 0.6830164194107056, 0.4681888520717621, 0.584776759147644, 0.5968074202537537, 0.8047782778739929, 0.7873324751853943, 0.7063025236129761, 0.6385250687599182, 0.45885229110717773, 0.4796521067619324, 0.8735318779945374, 0.8671290874481201, 0.87712562084198, 0.918270468711853, 0.7657012939453125, 0.30787569284439087, 0.45920297503471375, 0.8566880226135254, 0.9353315234184265, 0.8762115240097046, 0.41704341769218445, 0.669092059135437, 0.8164217472076416, 0.6316333413124084, 0.7482073307037354, 0.6762280464172363, 0.51824551820755, 0.3421834111213684, 0.36016881465911865, 0.4531695246696472, 0.444304883480072, 0.3276692032814026, 0.9558366537094116, 0.8843747973442078, 0.27591222524642944, 0.9774462580680847, 0.46772533655166626, 0.6739017963409424, 0.8069818615913391, 0.7126388549804688, 0.9720728993415833, 0.7776540517807007, 0.46089234948158264, 0.9451936483383179, 0.7969622015953064, 0.3730139434337616, 0.25679466128349304, 0.9297925233840942, 0.6632516384124756, 0.7952889800071716, 0.6207948923110962, 0.9255770444869995, 0.9378311634063721, 0.4968723654747009, 0.4113944172859192, 0.7722851037979126, 0.6650874018669128, 0.47548311948776245, 0.8121811151504517, 0.6660175919532776, 0.915021538734436, 0.7155582308769226, 0.5866425633430481, 0.9513949155807495, 0.7796556949615479, 0.5382027626037598, 0.759131669998169, 0.9018206000328064, 0.9237736463546753, 0.4717104732990265, 0.26270806789398193, 0.484455406665802, 0.44861143827438354, 0.5423704385757446, 0.3524637520313263, 0.5414443016052246, 0.43463948369026184, 0.3239045739173889, 0.9073935747146606, 0.5520520806312561, 0.7386409044265747, 0.39578989148139954, 0.5338932275772095, 0.45888328552246094, 0.484883189201355, 0.9470267295837402, 0.4720650911331177, 0.582586944103241, 0.2508929967880249, 0.7854301929473877, 0.8064908981323242, 0.9601837992668152, 0.6970961093902588, 0.718776524066925, 0.8646801710128784, 0.5701252818107605, 0.8423866033554077, 0.6313561797142029, 0.7491816282272339, 0.787189245223999, 0.9124131202697754, 0.7543750405311584, 0.5099787712097168, 0.8264291286468506, 0.8589133024215698, 0.8578064441680908, 0.8282365798950195, 0.7652966976165771, 0.35914814472198486, 0.7602911591529846, 0.5303962230682373, 0.4619883894920349, 0.820576548576355, 0.27152019739151, 0.7663620710372925, 0.8092288374900818, 0.7188912034034729, 0.8087074756622314, 0.6392309069633484, 0.6152198314666748, 0.8815100789070129, 0.5759385228157043, 0.5062625408172607, 0.2596462666988373, 0.7969857454299927, 0.6968626379966736, 0.2515207529067993, 0.6644052267074585, 0.8395583629608154, 0.8579063415527344, 0.5179752111434937, 0.7029902935028076, 0.8008149862289429, 0.7698614597320557, 0.6469528079032898, 0.6970571279525757, 0.6402348875999451, 0.9138017892837524, 0.5684121251106262, 0.9076570272445679, 0.809266209602356, 0.45129257440567017, 0.7931593656539917, 0.8018220067024231, 0.7404188513755798]]"," good pass protector, but he has struggled in pass protection in the past.
Warmack would be a great fit due to his ability to take double teams away from quarterback AJ McCarron. He also played well against the Jets on Sunday, and that was considered a strong showing from Warmack when he was playing in college.
The Bears could also take a more measured approach in the draft. Kyle Long, who has been with the Bears for 10 seasons, is the most experienced guard in the NFL. The Bears could look to bring him back for a third season.
Here is a closer look at the guard position and key players.
1. The Bears went in two different directions at left tackle this season. They signed Jermon Bushrod and then drafted Gabe Carimi. Both players will compete for the starting job at left tackle, but also have to battle for playing time at right guard.
Bushrod is a center in the NFL and has only played left tackle a handful"," strong left blocker, though his run blocking could get some help with better protection from outside tackles such Brandon Williams or Cody Miller coming into Chicago next fall if Warmack is gone by next spring's draft weekend — unless Warmak is a reach. Warmak has a lot of upside if used correctly by a future Bears staff as the line has been in dire needs of a true left-handed power forward for four or six straight cycles now (Rashaid Salajuis and Lydius Adams come immediately and fit perfectly), while a left-handed power running back would help an offense (like Mike Davis' and Jay Cutler's own production over two seasons ago and more so ever after last spring's surgery). Warmak is a player who could benefit by working out at a Bears run defense facility to get in tune with some of what Matt Pace has to offer. The player to look out for is Warmaker — a guy to follow through the draft to help the line get back to being dominant (",200,200,0.3679108417034149,0.422501620054245,"{'num_tokens_scored': 195, 'num_green_tokens': 191, 'green_fraction': 0.9794871794871794, 'z_score': 23.525254660419872, 'p_value': 1.1249809302491814e-122, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

It’s been a busy six months for Municipal Affairs Minister Chuck Porter, who took over the helm of the department in early July 2018.
“Municipal Affairs is a busy spot. There is a lot going on,” he told the Valley Harvester in early January. Porter’s portfolio includes the Office of the Fire Marshal, as well as the Emergency Management Office (EMO).
“Being minister for the entire province and not just one area can take a bit to get your head around when you’re passionate about the issues happening at home in your own constituency, but the key is to treat everyone the same. There is a variety of challenges among the municipalities, but also a lot of similar challenges and they’re all trying to operate on their tax base,” he said.
Porter said he encourages collaboration among municipalities so they can get the most bang for their bucks, but is trying not to put too much pressure on them after facilitating the special legislation consolidating Windsor and West Hants. So far, no other unit has requested consolidation legislation, but Porter isn’t ruling anything out.
Some councillors across the region had expressed concerns over the other legislation Porter brought to the Nova Scotia legislature in the fall: Bill 58, which requires municipalities to share their planning with neighbouring units. That doesn’t equal needing their permission, said Porter.
While he’s not in a position to share what legislation is coming forward in the house of assembly’s spring session, Porter said priorities the department has include revamping the Municipal Government Act and looking at changes to the Capped Assessment Program (CAP), which establishes a ceiling on what the amounts residential property assessments can increase annually. “There’s been a lot of talk about the unfairness of it, so maybe there is a better formula,” said Porter.
Challenges have a greater chance of creating more opportunities, but going into a new year there are still some lingering, costly problems, such as the inter-municipal service agreement that created Valley Waste Resource Management. “I can’t really comment on it because it’s still before the courts, but I’m staying on the positive side that it will all work out,” said Porter.
Just before Christmas last year, Valley Waste Resource Management was cleared by the RCMP following a complaint from the County of Annapolis at the end of July.
“Valley Waste was never advised as to the nature of the complaint,” said communications manager Andrew Garrett in"," a statement. But Valley Waste Resource Management continues to be in a precarious financial position with more than $800,000 plus interest it says it is owed by the County of Annapolis for services between April 1 and Aug. 17, 2018. Valley Waste Resource Management still has control of its transfer station on Elliot Road, while the county appeals a decision from the judicial review concerning its expropriation that was handed down in late November.
County of Kings Mayor Peter Muttart said in an email the cost of the “break-up” has yet to be determined and arbitration the province offered to pay for is not an option if the other party does not agree to it. “The alternative to binding arbitration is expensive court procedures,” he said, adding that the appeal may not be heard until the spring.
In the meantime, remaining municipal partners will be reviewing the Valley Waste Resource Management 2019-2020 budget for cost savings to cover a 17 per cent increase to them.",744,544,200,90.49102425575256,101.39389419555664,"[[0.5350221395492554, 0.38813167810440063, 0.6117475628852844, 0.7744861245155334, 0.7889230847358704, 0.6259253025054932, 0.6582331657409668, 0.7210395336151123, 0.713318943977356, 0.9830268025398254, 0.9944207668304443, 0.5569132566452026, 0.8061323165893555, 0.28934767842292786, 0.8110859990119934, 0.401122123003006, 0.9838094711303711, 0.9944043159484863, 0.9783374667167664, 0.40622347593307495, 0.9503448009490967, 0.632319450378418, 0.7215723991394043, 0.993781566619873, 0.4906765818595886, 0.9831229448318481, 0.9936016798019409, 0.4039442539215088, 0.3572710156440735, 0.387394517660141, 0.2740330398082733, 0.2753241956233978, 0.951805591583252, 0.9277235269546509, 0.8664249181747437, 0.27915307879447937, 0.354386568069458, 0.25058072805404663, 0.859527587890625, 0.6112138628959656, 0.9939552545547485, 0.39280152320861816, 0.7019523978233337, 0.6834185719490051, 0.5754601955413818, 0.5175630450248718, 0.7784159183502197, 0.3298281133174896, 0.8267965316772461, 0.7576489448547363, 0.2615959644317627, 0.5325579643249512, 0.7553669810295105, 0.8386514186859131, 0.43881961703300476, 0.5444401502609253, 0.9027495980262756, 0.29829782247543335, 0.6245677471160889, 0.2530244290828705, 0.6039791107177734, 0.5036622285842896, 0.4914526045322418, 0.7761871814727783, 0.3125459849834442, 0.6079023480415344, 0.851861298084259, 0.7406699657440186, 0.4991435408592224, 0.2510465979576111, 0.286606103181839, 0.8708137273788452, 0.968941867351532, 0.9014793038368225, 0.5708048343658447, 0.2822990119457245, 0.6512047648429871, 0.2509784400463104, 0.42038118839263916, 0.8431514501571655, 0.6852009296417236, 0.576690673828125, 0.46133458614349365, 0.7884545922279358, 0.4980778396129608, 0.9298133254051208, 0.2932226061820984, 0.4704064130783081, 0.9162516593933105, 0.7332741618156433, 0.4580425024032593, 0.8647463321685791, 0.8119663000106812, 0.5190563201904297, 0.6457141637802124, 0.6664183139801025, 0.4959641993045807, 0.6344557404518127, 0.56216961145401, 0.9064011573791504, 0.31066784262657166, 0.475713849067688, 0.35442689061164856, 0.7117236256599426, 0.27274155616760254, 0.3905426859855652, 0.632030725479126, 0.813105046749115, 0.5206117630004883, 0.3394600749015808, 0.5833565592765808, 0.28394752740859985, 0.5126052498817444, 0.8927993774414062, 0.6222444176673889, 0.27505040168762207, 0.3907564878463745, 0.3441675901412964, 0.2630288898944855, 0.34392479062080383, 0.5694478750228882, 0.4509682357311249, 0.5117990970611572, 0.5517658591270447, 0.8459573984146118, 0.45596158504486084, 0.6027655601501465, 0.3993087708950043, 0.7328494787216187, 0.32198673486709595, 0.5762062072753906, 0.7526357173919678, 0.7045049667358398, 0.5529296398162842, 0.6035694479942322, 0.8018129467964172, 0.339358389377594, 0.5333117842674255, 0.47769924998283386, 0.7197595834732056, 0.27498579025268555, 0.5089181661605835, 0.5813375115394592, 0.39679667353630066, 0.30566108226776123, 0.5887959003448486, 0.5000458359718323, 0.41946935653686523, 0.29901614785194397, 0.5693303942680359, 0.41955822706222534, 0.2542386054992676, 0.27897146344184875, 0.28135448694229126, 0.26603302359580994, 0.2633195221424103, 0.327846497297287, 0.3040531575679779, 0.30818936228752136, 0.2604096531867981, 0.4665391147136688, 0.3090463876724243, 0.25106438994407654, 0.2607520818710327, 0.25917476415634155, 0.2570440471172333, 0.2568940222263336, 0.2764016389846802, 0.2788427770137787, 0.2672857642173767, 0.25599172711372375, 0.3870353698730469, 0.28580671548843384, 0.2506074905395508, 0.2555554509162903, 0.25326254963874817, 0.2537752091884613, 0.2548285126686096, 0.2641850411891937, 0.2666446268558502, 0.25473999977111816, 0.2537670433521271, 0.3545168340206146, 0.2710961401462555, 0.25041526556015015, 0.25350451469421387, 0.2517021596431732, 0.25215888023376465, 0.2545817196369171, 0.25966933369636536, 0.2624233067035675, 0.25164175033569336, 0.25273755192756653, 0.3390292525291443, 0.26543641090393066, 0.2503470480442047, 0.25280821323394775, 0.2511715888977051, 0.25142472982406616, 0.25554850697517395]]"," an email. “Valley Waste was notified in writing on August 28, 2018, that the County was not satisfied with the service agreement and that Valley Waste was being directed to discontinue its services to the County effective immediately.”
The County of Annapolis has since been awarded a contract for the services of the Annapolis Waste Management Authority, which is expected to be in place in 2020.
“We’re talking about a $10 million dollar transfer of costs from the County of Annapolis to the Municipality of Annapolis,” said Porter. “There are certainly some things we’re going to have to do with our business partners to help mitigate that.”
While the county is working on its own plans to share services with the municipality, Porter said he’s looking to see how Valley Waste handled the situation.
“I have to say, Valley Waste handled it very well,” he said. “We"," December of a letter from then assistant county commissioner Jeff Wilson to Valley Waste executive officer Mark Hough and council members Brad Ward, Brian Ostrand as well as a county of East Hant commissioner Mike Campbell after a request made by Valley Waste on Nov 22 requesting a review of its intermunicipal agreement signed by Hough and county of East Hant commissioner Mike Campbell back when Hough was county commissioner at Centreville and Centre Island (before serving as a county commissioner of Valley East) in 2011 and 2013 when East Hant was its jurisdiction at Centre Island (before serving as a county commissioner of Valley North) from 2011 to 2014 when Centre Island was the county seat between 2011-2014 when Centre Island was the county seat between 2011-2014 when Centre Island was the county seat between 2011-2014 when Centre Island was the county seat between 2011-2014 when Centre Island was the county seat between 2011-2014 when Centre Island was the county seat between 2011-2014 when Centre Island was the county seat",200,200,0.4524551212787628,0.5069694709777832,"{'num_tokens_scored': 125, 'num_green_tokens': 121, 'green_fraction': 0.968, 'z_score': 18.53868028384617, 'p_value': 5.033080012846923e-77, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

5556,"FOUR of Diamonds have defended Honey G after they lost out on their place on the X Factor last night – while the controversial rapper was saved.
The girl group insisted Honey – real name Anna Guildford – “deserved” her place in the music contest as she works so hard.
The band - made up of Caroline, Lauren, Yasmin and Sophia - have also jumped to the defence of mentor Louis Walsh, insisting they couldn’t wish for a more “caring” judge.
And asked about Honey G being kept in the competition, despite furious backlash from viewers, they told us: “We all love Honey G, she’s great and she works so hard. She deserves her place as much as anyone else in the competition now.
And it’s not just Honey they’re full of praise for, as despite claims there had been tension with mentor Louis, all four girls couldn’t gush about him more.
“Louis doesn’t get enough credit as a mentor, he is so lovely to work with and he’s so caring,” Lauren told us.
“We spend so much time with him, we have his number, we used to call and text him all the time… He really cares, and I don’t think many people see that side of him.
The girl group got off to a rocky start on the live shows, as they were brought in to replace Brooks Way at the last minute, as the"," duo quit amid assault allegations.
Four of Diamonds broke down in tears ahead of the performance on Saturday over negative comments they had received online, after they were saved over singer Gifty Louise.
The Sun exclusively revealed previously that the band had been formed in a workshop, after all four girls auditioned as solo artists.
And explaining exactly how it happened, Caroline revealed: “We had our producers audition, and interviewed as solo artists, then management company got involved which was separate from the show got in touch, and they put us together at a workshop, before we met the judges as a group.
While Ryan Lawrie and Emily Middlemas are more loved up than ever, Lauren admitted there’s no other romances in the house.
The girls also appeared on Lorraine today, and Yasmin said: ""We are so happy to have got this far. We got sent out at Judges Houses, and now we're back here, we're just so grateful.""",517,317,200,81.33079862594604,92.23015546798706,"[[0.895313560962677, 0.906316339969635, 0.7776122093200684, 0.25794219970703125, 0.25198477506637573, 0.27932441234588623, 0.7263792753219604, 0.8579497933387756, 0.5600277185440063, 0.6218311786651611, 0.6181161403656006, 0.25322961807250977, 0.9204227328300476, 0.6381615996360779, 0.7053566575050354, 0.3290346562862396, 0.25559625029563904, 0.8298766016960144, 0.8657376170158386, 0.8656343817710876, 0.3596961796283722, 0.2927893102169037, 0.47600045800209045, 0.4528404772281647, 0.8062382936477661, 0.93607097864151, 0.8831306099891663, 0.7993124723434448, 0.9325640201568604, 0.4878808259963989, 0.9090173840522766, 0.7768440246582031, 0.6750983595848083, 0.7230945229530334, 0.4492134749889374, 0.7246732711791992, 0.8796566128730774, 0.900944173336029, 0.5486746430397034, 0.7181165218353271, 0.6549915075302124, 0.3087459206581116, 0.2952571511268616, 0.7221606969833374, 0.918204128742218, 0.9253839254379272, 0.5839783549308777, 0.777590274810791, 0.7704905271530151, 0.8814335465431213, 0.7476018667221069, 0.5764256715774536, 0.8037310838699341, 0.50532466173172, 0.4767003655433655, 0.8701083660125732, 0.819216251373291, 0.8622998595237732, 0.6971357464790344, 0.7738066911697388, 0.26523467898368835, 0.9058780670166016, 0.34145262837409973, 0.27480292320251465, 0.6358479261398315, 0.7520639300346375, 0.8178438544273376, 0.9386122822761536, 0.7023508548736572, 0.69179368019104, 0.795986533164978, 0.43073418736457825, 0.5848215222358704, 0.7054754495620728, 0.5703973174095154, 0.8865739107131958, 0.7827469110488892, 0.8774878978729248, 0.6372531652450562, 0.5613221526145935, 0.5275196433067322, 0.8710919618606567, 0.3334260582923889, 0.9213672876358032, 0.6230756044387817, 0.5258479714393616, 0.5226973295211792, 0.8632848262786865, 0.8830899000167847, 0.6904125809669495, 0.4975355863571167, 0.39179059863090515, 0.5310203433036804, 0.48835664987564087, 0.5778377652168274, 0.4867142140865326, 0.34020304679870605, 0.3817872107028961, 0.35583794116973877, 0.5658236145973206, 0.49550315737724304, 0.30578720569610596, 0.31533756852149963, 0.3090426027774811, 0.5511965751647949, 0.4823458790779114, 0.2760236859321594, 0.2803507447242737, 0.28898006677627563, 0.5247758030891418, 0.44853127002716064, 0.264227956533432, 0.26683640480041504, 0.27905672788619995, 0.4789353311061859, 0.4045269787311554, 0.2598089277744293, 0.2607327103614807, 0.2738609313964844, 0.4383922815322876, 0.37142214179039, 0.2568090260028839, 0.2571524977684021, 0.26943278312683105, 0.4078623950481415, 0.3483562171459198, 0.25562629103660583, 0.25553202629089355, 0.26622751355171204, 0.383374959230423, 0.3318041265010834, 0.25525370240211487, 0.2546864151954651, 0.2639768123626709, 0.36409634351730347, 0.32526910305023193, 0.2552146017551422, 0.25392502546310425, 0.26226919889450073, 0.34739387035369873, 0.31831079721450806, 0.2547643780708313, 0.2535131275653839, 0.2614646255970001, 0.3376428484916687, 0.31129106879234314, 0.25451722741127014, 0.2533402442932129, 0.26065149903297424, 0.3314070403575897, 0.30820366740226746, 0.2539016008377075, 0.25308358669281006, 0.2597576975822449, 0.3221070170402527, 0.3009280264377594, 0.2533075213432312, 0.2528507113456726, 0.25925806164741516, 0.31475958228111267, 0.2958376407623291, 0.25287362933158875, 0.25268054008483887, 0.2587760090827942, 0.30895930528640747, 0.2953763008117676, 0.2523585855960846, 0.2525613307952881, 0.2581790089607239, 0.3040812611579895, 0.29632747173309326, 0.25208038091659546, 0.2524779438972473, 0.25767195224761963, 0.3004622459411621, 0.2939222753047943, 0.2518494427204132, 0.2523415982723236, 0.2570982277393341, 0.2982883155345917, 0.29092857241630554, 0.25160250067710876, 0.25219517946243286, 0.25663769245147705, 0.29473844170570374, 0.28771159052848816, 0.25139278173446655, 0.2521304488182068, 0.25624945759773254, 0.29228508472442627, 0.28447556495666504, 0.2512781322002411, 0.25207194685935974, 0.25616833567619324, 0.2897859215736389, 0.27993258833885193, 0.25113406777381897, 0.25196680426597595, 0.2559763491153717, 0.2875737249851227]]"," original line-up were all tired and just after the X Factor final.
But, despite making it through to the next stage, the group’s run on the show has been marred by controversy.
After finding out they’d lost out on their chance to be on the show, the girl band recruited a lawyer to fight the decision.
And it wasn’t on the X Factor panel that the drama started, as they took to Twitter to complain about the decision – and the “unfair” and “unjust” treatment they’d been given.
They even branded the show “rigged” and “biased” – and demanded their place back.
But they were told they were “the X Factor” and didn’t get their way!
And now, things have gotten even worse for the group.
“It’s just awful. I don’t"," original members couldn´´ t get back in together due to travel time constraints due to some travelling commitments abroad… However the band now have some time to get themselves together as it is now into week seven in The Pop Star Survival Show, however Lauren admitted to being a big mess, while on the XS. “We are so stressed out from last week – it really was a mess, it was such a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess, it was a mess,",200,200,0.4066539931297302,0.4611507773399353,"{'num_tokens_scored': 84, 'num_green_tokens': 84, 'green_fraction': 1.0, 'z_score': 15.874507866387543, 'p_value': 4.757715365331782e-57, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

4410,"Churchville-Chili swimmers Tyler Regelsberger and Brandon Crist set sights on making an impact at states.
Churchville-Chili seniors Brandon Crist and Tyler Regelsberger are Section V’s dynamic duo, the Batman and Robin of Section V boys swimming.
Who’s who is up for debate.
They both wear goggles like Robin's mask, but have builds like Batman. “The Boy Wonder” would serve as a fitting nickname for either.
Regelsberger disagrees with Crist, showcasing a less diplomatic version of The Caped Crusader.
One thing is certain, the 2017 Democrat and Chronicle All-Greater Rochester boys swimming selections have put together “super” performances this season.
The dynamic duo, who are also second cousins, have a combined nine top-four times across seven individual events and are members of a pair of Saints’ top-six relay times.
Regelsberger has recorded a top-three or better performance in five individual events this season. His 100-yard freestyle (48.31) performance is second-best in Section V, while his 200 freestyle (1:46.51), 200 individual medley (2:00.82), 50 freestyle (22.08) and 100 breast stroke (1:01.87) times are No. 3.
For the 100 butterfly (54.65) and 500 freestyle (4:52.12), his performances are good for No. 9 and No. 6, respectively.
His 50, 100, 200 and 500 freestyle times are state-meet qualifiers.
Not to be outdone, Crist has four top-four individual performances, including a Section V-best performance in the 500 freestyle (4:34.79). He has the No. 2 time in the 200 freestyle (1:44.33) and the No. 4 time in the 100 freestyle (49.09) and 100 butterfly (53.72).
His 100 backstroke (57.02) is ninth-best in Section V, while his 50 freestyle (22.64) is top-10 and 200 individual medley (2:07.53) is good for No. 13.
His 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle and 100 butterfly times are good enough to qualify for states.
The pair also regularly participate in the Saints’ 200 and 400 freestyle relays, with the fifth-best sectional time in the 400 (3:28.06) and sixth-best time in the 200 freestyle (1:35.07).
As for whether Batman would better serve as a lead or anchor, Regelsberger sees himself as a “lead-the-charge” version of the Bat.
Crist’s Dark Knight is more of a “save-the-day” type.
Except for Crist’s 500 freestyle, there are more than a number of second-bests and third-bests. Enter Pittsford",", whose program and individual dominance in the pool provides Churchville-Chili’s Dynamic Duo with their own personal Legion of Doom to battle against. Name an individual event or relay, and odds are a Panther tops the list.
Pittsford sits atop the latest Democrat and Chronicle’s large-schools swimming poll, whereas the Saints were left off, despite the efforts of Regelsberger and Crist. This isn’t the result the pair envisioned at the start of their final high school season, but are doing everything they can to unify their team and help it succeed.
As team leaders, much of the responsibility falls on the Saints’ standout seniors.
It will take a super-human effort to get Churchville-Chili back into the Class A team sectionals picture, but Regelsberger and Crist have the talent to pull it off.

2547,"A teenage health crisis led Surbhi Sarna to found a company aimed at detecting ovarian cancer early. Today Boston Scientific is purchasing the startup firm for up to $275 million.
A quest to detect ovarian cancer for other women led Sarna, 32, to found a company, nVision Medical of San Bruno, Calif., to raise $17 million in venture capital, and to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration to develop a specialized device for detecting ovarian cancer. (The device is not yet for sale.) Now Boston Scientific, the Marlborough, Mass.-based medical device giant, says it will buy nVision for $150 million upfront and another $125 million to be paid if certain clinical and commercial milestones are hit over the next four years. Sarna, who was on Forbes' 30 Under 30 In Healthcare list in 2014, plans to remain with the company.
""I did not start this company because I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I was looking for some concept,"" says Sarna. ""I did not start this company because I wanted to be a CEO or I wanted to be in charge. Those were all necessary things that I needed to do to get this product to where it needed to go. Now, this is the best place for me to be in order to keep seeing that happen.""
The market opportunity for the device could be from $500 million to $2 billion annually, says David Pierce, an executive vice president at Boston Scientific and president of the company's MedSurg division. Some 300,000 women have their ovaries removed each year, he says, mostly because they either have suspicious masses on them or because they carry a version of the BRCA gene that makes them very likely to develop cancer. The nVision device aims to give doctors a way to watch for cancer in these patients. ""We're really excited about this acquisition,"" Pierce says. ""The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is a massive unmet need in this space."" The deal could be accretive to Boston Scientific's earnings as soon as 2020.
Sarna is the daughter of Indian immigrants. Her mother, a Ph.D. in Hindi literature, stayed home to raise her children. Her father, an engineer, worked at a series of startups. She founded nVision straight out of college in 2009, continuing to work day jobs in the medical device industry. She had few connections, and often met with deaf ears. ""I've been in several boardrooms with all male VCs who are like, 'Oh. This is a women's issue,"" she says.
After a year and a half, she managed to raise $250,000. Her biggest backer was Darshana Zaveri, a woman who was a partner at Catalyst Health Ventures. Sarna hired an engineer named David Snow, who had been her boss at her last medical device job. Together they faced a huge engineering challenge. They needed to collect cells from the Fallopian tubes, which lead from the ovaries to the uterus. But these tubes, Sarna says, are a millimeter wide, between four and 12 centimeters long, and have, in he words, ""the consistency of wet paper towel."" Trying to push a catheter through them would risk damaging that delicate tissue.
Their solution? A balloon, which would follow the path up the Fallopian tube as it inflated, and would collect the cells on its surface. nVision conducted an initial 40-woman study to see if it could get the balloon into the Fallopian tube, and a second 40-woman study to prove that it could enter the full length of the tube and collect cells. A third study of woman who were having their ovaries removed compared the results of looking at the cells with the pathology reports on the ovaries to see if it could detect cancer. The results have not been published, but Sarna and Pierce both say that the test had high sensitivity and specificity. Contractually, the outside doctors who conducted the research have the right to be the first to release the results.
As nVision's product moved forward, investors became more interested. Astia Angels, an angel investing group, backed her, as did Michigan's Arboretum Ventures, which led a $12 million series B. She remembers first sitting down with a team from Boston Scientific at a medical meeting in Las Vegas several years ago. It was the end of the day, and they were all tired, but she remember the team's excitement. ""You know when someone just really gets something and understands it right away?"" she says. ""It was awesome.""
Last summer potential acquirers started expressing interest in the company. Sarna says she was in no hurry. Half her series B had not been spent, and Arboretum had set aside cash for another investment round. Boston Scientific was one potential buyer. But the meetings went so well that, at one point in negotiations, Sarna told a Boston Scientific executive: ""Hey. My team really likes your team."" She says she was thrilled that Boston is the company acquiring nVision. Thursday, two members of the Boston Scientific team flew across the country to take her to dinner at Octavia, an award-winning San Francisco Restaurant, where they ate steak and deviled eggs and talked for six hours. Her husband, an"," entrepreneur whose startup recently raised $60 million, was baffled that anyone could talk about work for so long.
The challenge will be convincing women and their doctors that it really is safe to watch for cancer using nVision's test. Boston Scientific plans a larger, 120-patient study. But Sarna says that women are already in a position of waiting and watching, and choosing to balance the health costs of removing their ovaries and going into early menopause and sacrificing some of their childbearing years with the risk of cancer. She says she wants to give them a better option than existing diagnostics, which she scoffs are no better than flipping a coin.

""She's very passionate, very bright, very driven woman and just a pleasure to work with,"" he says.

8970,"Viacom Inc.'s chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, is expected to tell investors and analysts at an industry conference in California today that his company will put most of Simon & Schuster, its $2 billion publishing operation, up for sale, people involved in the sale said yesterday.
Simon & Schuster's educational publishing businesses will most likely be put on the block. But Viacom is expected to hold onto the Simon & Schuster trade imprint, which has published such recent best sellers as ''Diana: Her True Story -- In Her Own Words,'' by Andrew Morton; ''The Christmas Box,'' by Richard Paul Evans, and ''Wait Till Next Year,'' by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company is said to have been hired to handle the sale, which analysts say could fetch $4 billion to $4.5 billion.
A Viacom spokesman declined to comment.
A Simon & Schuster sale has long been expected. Ever since Viacom acquired Paramount Communications in 1994, Mr. Redstone has shown little interest in the publishing operations.
When Paramount was independent, the book business assured steady earnings to stabilize the more volatile movie and television operations. But after the merger, Viacom's cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, offered the same type of stability and more opportunities for entertainment programming and marketing. The profit margins for the cable network business are also far higher.
The educational publishing division does, however, own some fast-growing operations, including Computer Curriculum Publishing, which provides computer programs for schools, and the Educational Management Group, which delivers live interactive custom curriculums to two million students in 4,000 schools.
It is not clear yet whether the Simon & Schuster businesses would be sold in pieces or as a whole.
Educational publishers like McGraw-Hill and Harcourt Brace might be interested in acquiring the kindergarden-through-high school publishing business or the college textbook operation; other companies may want just Computer Curriculum.
Bantam Doubleday Dell, owned by Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant, has been widely speculated to be interested in buying into Simon & Schuster. Stuart Applebaum, a Bantam Doubleday spokesman, however, said yesterday that the company was not interested in the educational division but only in trade publishing, a unit not expected to be up for sale.
A top executive at Simon & Schuster said that all the decisions were being made out of Viacom and that they knew little about the parent company's plans. Meetings are scheduled today for the division's top executives with Simon & Schuster's chief executive, Jonathan Newcomb.
According to people involved with the sale, Viacom has not yet begun circulating the detailed financial data that buyers require to analyze a prospective acquisition. Still, Viacom is said to hope a deal will be completed by the second or third quarter of 1998.
In the 1996 fiscal year, Simon & Schuster accounted for $2.3 billion of the company's $12.1 billion in revenue and for $217 million of the $1.2 billion in operating income.
In contrast, the company's cable networks and broadcasting business generated roughly the same revenue, $2.4 billion, but $630 million in operating income -- or nearly three times that of the publishing business. Since 1994, the book business's profits have jumped only 12.7 percent, while the network and broadcasting business has seen a 95 percent surge in profits.
Viacom had considered spinning off some of its publishing assets, but in order to do a spinoff without generating large taxes, the company would have to to hold onto the assets for at least"," five years. That would have forced it to keep Simon & Schuster until 1999, clearly too long for Mr. Redstone.
''They're biting the bullet,'' said John Tinker an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ''But the real question now is how much they actually get and how fast they can actually pay off'' Viacom's $8 billion debt, he said.
The consumer book division, the Simon & Schuster operation that Viacom is said to be keeping, is a business that generally makes little money and operates at low margins. Still, the business offers Viacom the chance to cross-market books and films.
Not every media company, however, has been interested in such potential synergies. The Seagram Company, for example, which acquired both the publisher Putnam Berkley Group and Universal Studios when it acquired MCA, decided in 1996 to sell the publisher to Pearson P.L.C.'s Penguin Group for $336 million.",967,767,200,100.27699613571167,111.14876818656921,"[[0.7336449027061462, 0.3143802881240845, 0.5117781162261963, 0.9026684761047363, 0.38574519753456116, 0.6781951189041138, 0.41230785846710205, 0.2527464032173157, 0.40880411863327026, 0.6190891861915588, 0.31609371304512024, 0.3048040270805359, 0.25009751319885254, 0.2500474750995636, 0.5146335959434509, 0.6220188140869141, 0.5335536003112793, 0.6942799091339111, 0.46525880694389343, 0.2546328604221344, 0.9227463006973267, 0.8690614104270935, 0.5355325937271118, 0.2803879976272583, 0.25658220052719116, 0.655426025390625, 0.5918825268745422, 0.46033117175102234, 0.4266130328178406, 0.5551125407218933, 0.5682291984558105, 0.42654627561569214, 0.43619877099990845, 0.7321283221244812, 0.28367701172828674, 0.5081042647361755, 0.5800415277481079, 0.8116904497146606, 0.7208898663520813, 0.2879573404788971, 0.5081905126571655, 0.8240267634391785, 0.2555634081363678, 0.7420921325683594, 0.5125998854637146, 0.45400550961494446, 0.8060873746871948, 0.6517062783241272, 0.7439809441566467, 0.49235105514526367, 0.38519471883773804, 0.5874583721160889, 0.8733726739883423, 0.8131899833679199, 0.5608413219451904, 0.3093537986278534, 0.5905625224113464, 0.5438107252120972, 0.2747616767883301, 0.7834547162055969, 0.780119001865387, 0.2503056228160858, 0.2501153349876404, 0.48785191774368286, 0.6841529011726379, 0.7145867943763733, 0.6105228662490845, 0.3704054653644562, 0.44558969140052795, 0.8752433657646179, 0.7817796468734741, 0.2678734064102173, 0.7618176341056824, 0.8852816820144653, 0.42166799306869507, 0.6544981002807617, 0.8100247383117676, 0.6041622757911682, 0.5426120162010193, 0.8157309889793396, 0.8559941649436951, 0.7025683522224426, 0.6455115079879761, 0.5186120271682739, 0.4433894455432892, 0.6633180379867554, 0.6563205122947693, 0.9387528300285339, 0.7798672914505005, 0.8890410661697388, 0.8209199905395508, 0.6332637071609497, 0.9227719902992249, 0.9196708798408508, 0.6338834762573242, 0.7170833945274353, 0.5912687182426453, 0.7189225554466248, 0.7866965532302856, 0.2576628029346466, 0.8015071749687195, 0.4739514887332916, 0.38761118054389954, 0.6954345107078552, 0.7596450448036194, 0.37650009989738464, 0.872893750667572, 0.4609244763851166, 0.37483012676239014, 0.6806290745735168, 0.2576131224632263, 0.8779102563858032, 0.272684246301651, 0.3096087574958801, 0.3809976577758789, 0.6813346147537231, 0.46917837858200073, 0.256709486246109, 0.2509036064147949, 0.7044122219085693, 0.744260847568512, 0.6798882484436035, 0.8648977875709534, 0.8485142588615417, 0.2695927917957306, 0.2735922932624817, 0.8889337182044983, 0.6954957246780396, 0.9318731427192688, 0.8532418012619019, 0.8661799430847168, 0.9069545269012451, 0.7896250486373901, 0.9069150686264038, 0.8878923654556274, 0.8519046306610107, 0.6667040586471558, 0.8996455669403076, 0.8770967721939087, 0.8688079714775085, 0.9096695184707642, 0.8851125836372375, 0.7815654277801514, 0.8478279113769531, 0.7237794995307922, 0.7427934408187866, 0.8935493230819702, 0.6700854897499084, 0.815505862236023, 0.702231764793396, 0.5497267246246338, 0.38200902938842773, 0.41529035568237305, 0.3714683949947357, 0.3012884855270386, 0.33673569560050964, 0.307348370552063, 0.2750502824783325, 0.31336456537246704, 0.28198474645614624, 0.26527419686317444, 0.3032954931259155, 0.2741451561450958, 0.26173028349876404, 0.29423788189888, 0.27036064863204956, 0.26020750403404236, 0.2895045876502991, 0.269258588552475, 0.26009148359298706, 0.2847158908843994, 0.2691837549209595, 0.2603757679462433, 0.27966734766960144, 0.269464910030365, 0.2596217095851898, 0.274941086769104, 0.27045145630836487, 0.260757178068161, 0.2728407084941864, 0.2693489193916321, 0.26090505719184875, 0.2717145085334778, 0.26783424615859985, 0.2604618966579437, 0.2682119905948639, 0.2683105766773224, 0.2615458369255066, 0.2661699056625366, 0.2669399082660675, 0.26142072677612305, 0.26441293954849243, 0.26542335748672485, 0.2624211609363556, 0.26265016198158264, 0.26363053917884827, 0.262559175491333, 0.26122263073921204, 0.2623004615306854, 0.2636527121067047]]"," two years.
As part of the sale, Viacom will also likely retain the Viacom DreamWorks film production and distribution business, which is worth about $1.6 billion, people involved with the sale said.
The company's cable networks have become a significant source of revenue. The networks have generated nearly $1 billion since 1994 and brought in $2.9 billion in revenue last fiscal year.
The company's cable networks, including MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, also offer the opportunity for advertising. The cable networks have entered into partnerships with major advertisers, such as Kodak and Kodak Inc., to distribute their products to cable subscribers.
The cable networks have also become a way to promote Viacom's programming. Viacom executives have been working to promote ''The Consumer's Guide to the Viacom Network,'' a guide that contains information about the company's channels, including their programs, programming and channels.

8636,"Zuke Chutoro, seared Bluefin tuna cured in Soy sauce at Kusakabe in San Francisco, Calif., is seen on Saturday, July 19th, 2014.
Sitting in Kusakabe at the light polished wood sushi counter, cut from a single tree, with a delicate glass pitcher of sake, a small hand towel in a black saucer and the fifth of 11 courses, the thought emerges: This style of refined dining could also be a boon for fixed-price Western restaurants.
The people who say they wouldn't go to the French Laundry, Benu or Saison because of the precious parade of courses, the formal atmosphere and the extended length of time at the table are some of the same people sitting at the sushi counter eating one bite of delicate sushi after another, as one hour slips into the next.
It's hard not to be captivated by the skill of chef-owner Mitsunori Kusakabe. There are no decisions to be made as diners sit back, relax and are taken on a culinary journey that costs $95 for 11 dishes, mostly sushi but with a soup course and another hot dish.
Dinner begins with a briny broth of kelp tea designed to decompress the 17 patrons at the sushi bar and the 12 who are seated at tables. The waiter also brings a damp black finger towel so diners can wipe their fingers after picking up the sushi with their hands - the way suggested by the waiter, who is as calming as the tea.
Kusakabe defines his menu as omakase sushi, kaiseki style, referring to two distinct types of dining. Kaiseki is a set menu, precisely designed and served. A true omakase menu is based on individual diners' preferences gleaned from their ongoing relationship with the chef. It's a menu built on trust.
Yet in a broader sense the term is accurate here because the chef creates the menu; it's somewhat standardized, but on each of my three visits he made adjustments. Every ingredient is sliced, chopped, drizzled and squeezed to order.
For the first course, the chef places a piece of bluefin tuna, dark from its soy sauce cure, on a small pad of rice. He briefly torches half the flesh to caramelize it, intensify the flavor and firm up the texture - an artful contrast in a single bite.
Next comes a piece of halibut sliced to order, with shallow slits in the flesh to help diffuse the flavorings. The chef adds a dab of its liver gently scooped from a tiny tin, places it on the center of the white flesh, dribbles on a soy-like sauce and tops it with delicate ribbons of shiso. Next up is bonito with a small mound of pickled daikon and rings of scallions.
The sashimi - slices of amber jack and halibut because I am allergic to the scallops that would normally be part of the mix - is arranged on a mound of what looks like snow cone ice accompanied by a soy dipping sauce and a chunky blend of yuzu and onions.
Miso soup offered a warm change of pace, an intense broth with two tender duck meatballs, mitsuba (Japanese parsley) and a hint of sansho peppers. On other visits the soup featured summer truffles floating among the ribbons of herbs, with eringi and shimeji mushrooms visible just below the surface. The flavors are at once strong and subtle.
Next comes what's labeled unique sushi, although everything that came before could be described the same way. In this case, ""unique"" meant Tasmanian trout cured in kombu on two squares of rice flavored with cilantro and sesame seed. It was finished with sesame miso to bring all the flavors together.
On subsequent visits, the chef served a rice flour cracker that resembled a small pottery bowl shaped like a flower. It's so shiny and well formed that the chef had to tell me to pick it up and eat the entire thing, because I had started to use chopsticks to pick up the rice and barbecued eel on top.
Next is the second warm dish, which was the same on all three visits - two finger-size pieces of crab on tofu, caked in crispy rice and garnished with a slice of key lime so thin it looked like parchment. The waiter then pours on Hokkaido kombu dashi broth. It's yet another example of the tension between bold, subtle, crisp, creamy, warm and cool - the dish touches all those notes. This type of juxtaposition describes many of Kusakabe's dishes.
The next two bites, labeled ""sushi chic,"" included striped bass with a sprinkling of sea salt, gratings of Meyer lemon peel and a few drops of juice. In between each course the chef wipes off the black lacquer rectangles on the shelf above the counter in front of each diner, and replenishes the small bowls of pickled ginger.
For her part, the server is always subtly looking over diners' shoulders, answering questions and helping them to decide what to order from 16 sakes, 16 wines or five beers.
The sake is available in a 3-ounce glass, 6-ounce carafe or by the bottle. Each round is served in different containers - crystal cubes, thick earthen pottery, translucent green cups and long-stemmed wineglasses for the more expensive Daiginjo ($15-$30 for a 3-ounce pour).
The meal continues to progress from lighter to heavier preparations. Next is what turns out to be the most intriguing dish of all - Copper River salmon with just a sprig of microgreens on top. I could have sworn there was a brush of maple syrup because it was so sweet, but we were simply tasting the natural essence of the fish. In just about every case, the fish is served at the perfect stage for sushi.
To finish, there's a choice: a slice of A5 Wagyu or toro - a lush, fatty piece of fish - on a pad of rice and topped with a small knob of wasabi.
That's the end of the tasting menu. From there, diners can order from 20 a la carte sushi or sashimi items or, if you have an appetite like mine, you might want to try the expertly prepared Santa Barbara sea urchin ($8.50 per piece), Hokkaido uni ($14) or barbecued white eel ($14). Then there's whiting cured with kombu and bonito"," flakes ($8.50), cherrywood-smoked bonito ($8.50) and five maki rolls, including one with braised Japanese squash ($7.50).
Desserts are also extra: mild green tea creme brulee ($6) and a refreshing yuzu and shiso ice ($4.50) topped with a green tea cookie in the shape of a K.
By the time you get to that point you feel as satisfied and refreshed as if you've had a relaxing massage and rest.
On my last visit, as I was paying the bill, the gracious waiter leaned over and whispered that if I let them know next time, they would do preparations differently from the printed menu. Finally I discovered what a true omakase menu might mean.
Dinner Tuesday-Sunday, 5 p.m to last seating at 8:30 p.m. Beer, wine and sake. Reservations and credit cards accepted.

The fish is cooked at sea with a proprietary mixture of fish oil, soy sauce and herbs and spices. The chef also makes a traditional deep-fried version of the fish that will make you wish you had an appetite, too.
At the end of dinner, the server brings a black, plastic-wrapped box to the table, and we're told to discard the napkins. I'm not sure if we're supposed to rinse them before we pack them with a ladle of sake for the next person, or if it's a waste of effort. I can't say I ever have.
I think there's something magical about eating at a Japanese dining establishment in the company of other diners. The restaurant feels like an art gallery, with each plate as unique as the piece of art on the table. The diners are all there for the same reason.

8637,"BULLISH Alex McLeish is not expecting the chop when he meets Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner next week.
McLeish’s first season in charge has seen him narrowly avoid ­relegation and furious fans have called for his head.
With a record low four wins at home this season, McLeish has had to endure torrents of abuse from disgruntled supporters.
But he revealed that he will go into talks with"," the board outlining the kind of budget he thinks he needs to start turning the club around.
Big Eck said he hadn’t given any consideration to question marks over his future.
He said: “I haven’t ­given that any thought at all. Hopefully now we can move forward.
“I’ve been in charge one season. Did anyone expect me to win the league? Come on – I think people have to be more understanding.
“I anticipate being here next season. Yes, we have underachieved for a football club like Aston Villa.

Asked if he expected the chop, McLeish said: “No, I don’t.
“You think you’re going to go in there and you’re going to ­receive abuse and you’re going to ­receive the chop.
“But I’ll certainly go in there and discuss the ­situation with them.
“We’ve got to get on with what we’ve got to do. And we can’t ­hassle the fans.”
McLeish's side have been in a slump since the start of the season, losing six of their last eight league games.
Their last league win was on February 23, a 2-1 victory over Lincoln.
And McLeish, who is due to take charge of Scotland on June 10, has had"," manager John Smith, the man responsible to Lerner if things don’t get back to normal at M6-run-club Birmingham City by the middle-end next Tuesday. The Scot is not surprised by the hostile support he is facing either — because of recent results, the fans are simply unhappy after an indifferent period which has left them 16 games without three wins by their standards at just 16 matches. Lerner is a businessman who has to look after profits at Villa first after taking charge of Birmingham City in 2001 in a bid not lose his money out on the side in Birmingham City in the North of England to Leeds City in the North of England to Liverpool City in the North of England to Nottingham City in the North of England to Walsall City in the North of England to Walsall in the South of East Midlands to Burton City in the South of East Midlands to Shiremont on Saturday as well — as long a spell of the game lasts, and then on to Reading City in the",200,200,0.36211206793785095,0.4163820719718933,"{'num_tokens_scored': 174, 'num_green_tokens': 171, 'green_fraction': 0.9827586206896551, 'z_score': 22.322093586152832, 'p_value': 1.127403025759794e-110, 'z_score_at_T': tensor([ 1.7321,  2.4495,  3.0000,  3.4641,  3.8730,  4.2426,  4.5826,  4.8990,

5184,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - U.S. and Russian flight controllers worked to fully restore computers aboard the International Space Station on Thursday after a system crash that could force the $100 billion outpost’s crew back to Earth.
NASA said it did not regard the problem as critical and believed it was a long way from having to contemplate abandoning the space station, a 16-nation project.
But the U.S. space agency made plans to keep the visiting space shuttle Atlantis attached to the station for an extra day to help steer the massive complex if the Russian computers, which control navigation, continue to malfunction.
“We’re still struggling to understand what the real problem is here,” said NASA’s associate administrator for spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier.
Flight directors told the crew to cut power to noncritical equipment, like lighting, to conserve electricity and fuel in case the shuttle’s mission to the space station is extended.
In the worst-case scenario, the three astronauts aboard the station, including NASA’s newly arrived Clayton Anderson, could leave in the escape ship, a Russian Soyuz capsule.
As a precaution, the Soyuz was put on battery power on Wednesday for seven hours before one primary and one auxiliary computer system in the Russian modules were rebooted on Thursday, allowing the capsule to be returned to station power.
Two other primary systems, which control navigation and operate life support systems like an oxygen generator and air purifiers, remained shut down.
The station has backup systems for life support and the shuttle has been firing its control jets to help it maintain proper orbit.
“We won’t ask you how you’re doing because we can imagine,” a Russian flight director, speaking through a translator, said to station commander Fyodor Yurckikhin, who skipped a night’s sleep to work on the computer problems.
The computer glitches began shortly after a newly installed solar wing panel began producing power. Gerstenmaier said it would likely take days to find out why the computers were misbehaving.
Work continued on Thursday on the retraction of the second half of an older solar wing panel that must be moved before the new array can rotate and track the sun for full power.
Spacewalking astronauts Patrick Forrester and Steven Swanson helped guide the old wing into its storage"," box on Wednesday. Their crewmates James Reilly and John “Danny” Olivas are due to finish the job during a spacewalk on Friday.
Reilly and Olivas also are scheduled to repair a bit of protruding insulation near the rear of the shuttle. A corner of the blanket tore loose during Atlantis’ launch six days ago, potentially exposing inner layers of the shuttle’s surface to superheated gases on re-entry.
NASA had already extended Atlantis’ mission from 11 to 13 days and added a fourth spacewalk to make sure there was enough time to fix the blanket and retract the old solar wing.
The astronauts must also prepare other station systems for the arrival of new laboratory units and life support equipment for an expanded, six-person resident crew.

Forrester, the first NASA spacewalker to venture outside the space station, said the spacewalk was very difficult.
“We’ve got to do a lot of wrapping around, a lot of caressing, a lot of massaging of this thing,” Forrester told Reuters.
“We’ve got to make sure this thing is all right.”
NASA said on Wednesday that the space station had been operating normally, but that the glitch could pose a risk to the two-man U.S. crew.
It was not clear how long it would take to repair the computers, and NASA said it could take days to identify the root cause of the problem."," bin in preparation next Wednesday on launch day when it is lifted off a launchpad at Cape Canaveral Airport near Palm Harbor just outside of Florida City in the Tampa bay region to reach orbit. The wing is now on a trailer to a nearby hangar to be moved to pad 39. The crew planned to move it at night and launch at day when they arrive to continue preparations for a long stay on top of the space outpost, the world's longest spaceflight ever. The launch is set to take off this evening at 2323 GMT. The orbit is set to start at 11:40 a.m EST, or 2210 GMT.
It is a rare mission.

6748,"Napier shearer Ricci Stevens on Saturday night in Te Kuiti adding the New Zealand Senior shearing title to the woolhandling title he won two days earlier.
Napier shearer Ricci Stevens completed a unique double of doubles on Saturday night when he won a New Zealand Senior shearing title final, which would almost inevitably have its own special place in shearing sports history whomever won.
The 26-year-old had also on Thursday won the senior woolhandling title, having also previously won the junior titles in both aspects of the shearing sports – shearing in 2015 and woolhandling last year.
No other competitor has won New Zealand championships titles in both shearing and woolhandling.
The runner-up was King Country-based Catherine Mullooly, who as a junior on the same stage in 2014 became the first woman to be named top-ranked competitor in any grade of shearing and who last night was just 1.145pts from becoming the first female senior winner since the championships were first held as the King Country Shears in 1985.
Third place went to South Island-based Luis Pincol, from Chile, just 2.211pts from scoring the biggest-ever win by a shearer from South America.
The shape of the senior final changed dramatically when top-ranked Tegwyn Bradley, of Woodville, winner of 14 other finals during the season including the Golden Shears, was eliminated in the semifinals on Saturday afternoon.
Son-in-law of 2017 world champion and employer John Kirkpatrick, Stevens made his intentions clear",", more than 20 seconds clear of nearest challengers Mullooly and Pincol through the halfway stage and ultimately shearing the 12 sheep in 13min 58.38sec, half a minute clear of eventual second-man-off and Gore-based fourth placegetter Lionel Taumata, from Taumarunui.
Mullooly was third to finish, in 13min 31.28sec, and was by more than a point the best shearer in the board judging, but suffered in the judging in the pens afterwards.
The 2017 Intermediate champion, Masterton-based Sean Gouk, was fifth and sixth was Whakapunaki (Naki) Maraki, of Flaxmere, who on Thursday was fourth in the Junior woolhandling final won by partner Ngaira Puha.

The woolhandling final was almost boiling as his lead increased to over 20 points by the end of the first shearing run but he was then forced to ride out a 20-point second-run deficit to extend the lead to over 40 points.
""I was having a good run but I just stopped shearing when I had a bit of a wobble,"" Stevens said.
""I had a bit of a wobble on the first run and went right back to the top of the hill and I was going a lot slower than normal.
""I was lucky it wasn't a bigger deficit.""
Mullooly led into the second run and then held her position but Stevens, who had a 1.145pt lead going into the second run, was able to stretch his lead to a better margin GDP than the 33.625pts he scored in the first run.
