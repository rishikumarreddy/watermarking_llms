"Four members of the Connors family from Rumney, Cardiff, deny allegations from 2010 to 2013 at the city's crown court.
They are accused of forcing Michael Hughes and another man referred to as Mr K to work for tiny sums.
Defence barristers said the men kept coming back for work to sustain their drink and drug habits.
Prosecutor John Hipkin said Patrick Joseph Connors, 59, ran a driveway resurfacing and building firm, targeting  ""vulnerable"" victims using ""inflated"" prices.
He is on trial alongside Patrick Dean Connors, 39, William Connors, 36, and his son-in-law Lee Carbis, 34.
The court previously heard the alleged victims were paid Â£10 a day or less, sometimes in the form of alcohol or tobacco and were beaten or threatened if they did not follow orders.
But Kevin Seal, defending Patrick Dean Connors, said: ""This is not a case of them being shackled and somebody standing over them with a whip.
""They had access to shops, pubs and drug dealers in the case of Mr K.""
While he admitted they did not live in four star accommodation, he said: ""This is the lifestyle of somebody in the throes of, if not an addiction, then a longstanding reliance on alcohol"".
He described the allegations as ""fantastical"", saying Mr K's claim he was kidnapped and intimidated by a senior gang member ""like a Sopranos-type sketch.""
Defending Mr Carbis, Hashim Salmman said his client was friends with Mr Hughes to the extent he invited him to his wedding and let him borrow his Cardiff City season ticket.
""Gestures like this are not bandied around cheaply,"" he said.
On cross examination, Mr Hughes accepted that Mr Carbis bought him food at lunchtime and gave him Â£200 to go on holiday.
""They were friends on social media, spent time together outside of work, on occasion went together for a drink after work and Mr Hughes would refer to Mr Carbis as 'bruv',"" Mr Salmman added.
Earlier in the trial, the jury were shown photos of Mr Hughes on family holidays in Tunisia and Benidorm, something Mr Salmman said he could not have afforded if his version of events was accurate.
He said: ""How does the man you see in these photographs fit with the picture the prosecution has tried to paint- a cruel tale of woe, removal of independent will and despair?""
Terence Woods, defending William Connors, said by the time Mr Hughes worked for his client, he had moved away from the farm.
""He has chosen to stay in this area and he was earning cash in hand- up to Â£50 a day- so it would appear there is a pretty steady supply of work,"" he said.
All four defendants deny one count of requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2013.
Patrick Joseph Connors denies eight counts of causing actual bodily harm, four of kidnap and one of conspiracy to kidnap.
Elder son Patrick Dean Connors denies kidnapping and conspiracy to kidnap.
William Connors denies causing actual bodily harm between 2009 and 2013.
Mr Carbis also denies one count of kidnap between 2001 and 2002.
The trial continues.

"Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI) said the service was generally ""performing positively"" and delivering value for money.
But charity, Victim Support Wales, said it was ""not meeting its obligations"".
CPS Wales said it was ""working hard"" to ensure communication with victims was of a ""high standard"".
The report, published on Wednesday, found victims of crime or their bereaved relatives often had no information about the discontinuance of court proceedings or pleas.
Victim communication letters were not sent out in more than 45.5% of cases and only sent out in a ""timely manner"" in 50% of cases.
There was also a "" lack of empathy"" in some letters and they were sometimes sent out with the wrong information on outcomes.
Lucy Hastings, director at Victim Support, said: ""Poor communication can make victims feel forgotten and not treating them with the respect they deserve may increase their distress and make it harder for them to move beyond their experience of crime.""
CPS Wales was rated ""excellent"" for managing resources, ""good"" for managing performance, ""fair"" for the effectiveness of its joint working, with an overall score of ""good"" for its governance and value for money.
It was rated as ""fair"" for its compliance with disclosure requirements and casework reviews and decisions, ""good"" rating for case preparation and progression, ""poor"" for communicating with victims, with a ""fair"" overall rating for casework quality and service delivery for users.
The report found conviction rates in magistrates' courts was ""noticeably better"" than the national average - 87.2% versus 83.8% - and ""slightly"" better in the crown court - 79.9% compared to 79.1%.
However, the inspectorate said its crown court court performance was ""declining"" in contested cases, with those relating to rape and serious sexual offences a ""cause for concern"".
HMCPSI examined 120 magistrates' courts and crown court files finalised between September 2015 and March 2016, surveyed staff and got feedback from witnesses, victims and partner agencies.
They found over half the police files were ""not of sufficient quality"" but ""little or no challenge or feedback"" was provided to forces.
However, CPS Wales was found to have delivered value for money - in the 12 months to December 2015, it spent Â£430 per case while the national average was Â£602.
HMCPSI chief inspector of Kevin McGinty said while it was a ""positive report overall"", ensuring high-quality and timely communication with victims was ""essential"".
Ed Beltrami, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Wales, said: ""We recognise the need to provide an excellent service to victims and witnesses and we are already working hard to ensure that the quality of our communications with victims and witnesses is of a high standard and meets individual needs.
""This includes increasing the resources available within our victim liaison unit, implementing new arrangements for speaking with witnesses at court, on-going training for prosecutors and gathering feedback from victims.""

"Ten thousand miles away, though, in his adopted home of Fiji, his status is more similar to that of David Beckham.
""There aren't too many gingers on the island so it's hard to avoid being spotted,"" says Ryan.
""I can't really go for a quiet beer. If I visit the capital, Suva, I'll have to take a couple of hundred photos, every village knows my car now when I drive past and the people come out shouting and waving.""
The reason for the Londoner's popularity in Fiji is that he is the coach of the national rugby sevens team - and the most successful one the country's ever had.
He has guided them to the both the 2015 and 2016 Sevens World Series titles and he will also lead the team at this summer's Rio Olympics, where rugby sevens will make its debut.
And, for a country that has won the Sevens World Cup twice and the prestigious Hong Kong Sevens a record 16 times, hopes of a first ever Olympic medal are sky high.
""Suddenly we have a sport in the Games where we do get a lot of global success,"" said Ryan.
""The entire nation has already gone crazy about the road to gold.
""The people are very proud of their rugby teams and the boys do come from the people: they're unemployed, prison guards, army officers, hotel porters.
""So there's a real attachment to the group and the whole country will feel a collective pride. You can't bottle that.
""There's a chance we'll be in an Olympic final doing our best for a gold medal.""
The sport is not quite at the elevation of a religion in the devout, God-fearing archipelago, but it is not too far behind.
""It's something that binds villages together,"" explains Ryan. ""Everyone plays a random form of sevens in the villages before school and after work.
""Men, women and children play together - never with a rugby ball - but using coconuts or plastic bottles filled with sand.""
Ryan believes this passion, as well as year-round competitions and the natural athleticism of the Pacific islanders accounts for the nation's prowess, adding: ""I've seen teams of villagers beating visiting international sides like Argentina and France.""
The 44-year-old has called Fiji 'home' since 2013 after he left his post as England's sevens coach. In that role he had coached England to its first Sevens World Cup final in 20 years.
And, while living and working on a tropical island may sound like an obvious welcome change, it's not the only refreshing aspect of Fiji life.
""I've had a revival in my coaching. From falling out of love with rugby when I left England I'm very much in love with the game now,"" he said.
""It's polar opposites to the corridors of the Rugby Football Union where everything's regulated.
""I would be told if the players had spent too much time on the field and what music to play in the changing room for optimal motivation levels.
""In Fiji we train them until they can't run anymore.
""They eat brown coconuts before training and green ones afterwards.
""If I went back to a country with lots of money, I'd strip their programme down to the basics.""
But Ryan's Pacific adventure has not been all success and sun-kissed beaches.
When he first arrived he worked for several months unpaid as his employers ran into financial difficulties, and then in February this year the strongest cyclone ever to hit Fiji devastated the country -  killing more than 40 people and flattening communities.
Despite that, the sevens team have continued to shine and are on course to retain their Sevens World Series crown and also challenge for Olympic honours.
And Ryan feels the spirit among his team is worth more than the resources of other countries who can augment their squads in Rio with global XV-a-side stars such as Sonny Bill Williams, Bryan Habana and Bernard Foley.
""We certainly can win,"" said Ryan.
""New Zealand, South Africa and Australia are bringing in very well paid overseas professionals but we're picking the boys from the villages and we're using that as a real strength.
""The fact that they have no money and the fact that this will turn them into household names forevermore in Fiji is driving the team.
""The negative of not having any money can really be flipped on its head for us into a positive.
""If we're going to win a gold medal it's not going to be because of money - but because of heart and ability and the local boys from the villages doing their thing.""
After their 2015 Sevens World Series success the nation had a week of public holiday as celebration. What, then, if his team could bring home a first Olympic gold medal for the nation?
""The boys will be given houses and pieces of land; ministerial positions; jobs for life.
""They'll start a legacy.  We have a younger generation of sportsmen and women who are incredibly talented and rugby might just get the ball rolling for other sports as well.

The Sevens World Series is played out over a number of weekends in the autumn and winter. It is a nine-team tournament, with each side playing each other once.
The top two sides from each of the four World Series legs are then paired up for a final.
It's a format that is likely to be familiar to Fiji fans as the Pacific is where the country's rugby sevens players have a strong tradition of success.

"Police launched a manhunt after a man armed with a weapon tried to rob Coopers Jewellery in Barnstaple on Thursday afternoon.
Owner David Bruce said he ""cracked the man on the wrist"" with the bat when a gun was pointed at him.
Nothing was stolen from the shop and the police are continuing to investigate.
Four firearms units, a dog handler and local officers were among police looking for the man after reports of a robbery.
Mr Bruce said the man ""came marching straight in and slapped a big fat bag on the counter and asked me to fill it"".
""I told him you picked the wrong guy, he thought I was going to the safe but I got my baseball bat.
""He pointed the gun at me and I instinctively cracked him on the wrist with the baseball bat and the gun fired.""
Mr Bruce was not injured by the shot and said he then hit the man again twice with ""real force behind the blows"" before chasing him out of his shop.
He said the man ""was caught totally unawares"" and added: ""I come from a school of hard knocks. I wasn't scared.""
The raider was described as short and wearing a sandy or khaki coloured long trench coat.
Mr Bruce said he had a full latex mask on with a scarf and sunglasses and ""looked weird, like a cyborg with sunglasses"".
Devon and Cornwall Police said they believed the would-be robber's ""weapon was some kind of blank firing firearm"" and ""certainly don't think there's any risk to the public from the weapon he had"".

""We are carrying out enquiries to establish what was in the bag he was holding, and we are reviewing CCTV from the shop,"" a spokeswoman said.
She added: ""Officers are also following up on a number of information sources.""
An elderly man is thought to have been in the shop at the time of the incident.
Mr Bruce, who has been in the business for four decades, said: ""I'm very distressed. It's just a terrible thing to do.
""I'm a bit shaken up. I've just got to go through a bit of counselling and get some form of compensation.

"Sabah al-Numan told the BBC that many IS fighters had been killed.
Government forces entered the city's outskirts for the first time on Tuesday since the city was seized in June 2014.
Wednesday is the 17th day of the anti-IS operation, which involves 50,000 personnel including Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Sunni Arab tribesmen.
Elite troops seized control of the state TV building in Kukjali on Tuesday hours after launching an assault on the eastern district and later breached the outskirts of the Karama district.
A BBC journalist travelling with them said they were facing stiff resistance.
But Mr al-Numan, a spokesman for the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) said: ""We broke the front line of the centre of Mosul. We liberated a very important area which is the main gate for Mosul from the east.
""We had a very tough fight with ISIS in this area and we could liberate it very fast and also without any casualties, in front of many dead and executed from ISIS.""
Mosul is last major urban stronghold of IS in the country.
The men of the special forces appear casual - but make no mistake, they are ready.
Many have scars from Ramadi or Falluja or both. They have lost friends. Some are younger than you might expect for the fighting they have experienced.
Many are also recently married - common practice before deploying for battle - and keen to show pictures of their new brides on their smart phones.
From low-ranked soldiers to top generals, all say this is not going to be easy. The mission could take months.
But liberating Mosul is the fight they have been waiting for.
The ugly, deadly urban warfare of Mosul
Army units are also pushing into the south-eastern Judaydat al-Mufti area, according to the military.
The operation is backed by air and ground support from a US-led coalition.
On Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the 3,000 to 5,000 militants believed to still be inside Mosul that there was ""no escape"" and to ""either surrender or die"".
About 1,000 of the militants are thought to be foreigners. Gen Talib Shaghati al-Kenani said they came from Uzbekistan, Turkey and other countries.
""Those are a group of terrorists who fight Iraqis and usurp their cities,"" Gen Kenani said.
Many people have fled the area but some civilians have returned to their homes in villages around Mosul, some waving white flags to show they are not fighters.
As Mosul is encircled, UN officials have expressed concern for the safety of the 1.5 million civilians estimated to be living there.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Tuesday that it had received fresh reports of mass killings and forced relocations carried out by IS.
The UN Assistance Mission for Iraq said 1,792 people were killed in October, 1,120 of whom were civilians.

"The units were bought in 2008 for £1.25m as part of regeneration plans.
But proposals for a new shopping centre never came to fruition, and this year they were sold for £271,000.
Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy said the sales were ""staggering"", but the Welsh Government said they were done on professional advice.
Mr McEvoy said he had referred the matter to the Auditor General Huw Vaughan Thomas, with the Welsh Audit Office saying the concerns were ""being considered"" and it would ""deem if further investigation is required"".
Details of the transactions came to light following a request under the Freedom of Information Act by Mr McEvoy's office.
The Welsh Government bought one shop unit at 54/55 Taff Street for £800,000 and another unit, comprised of two shops, at 69 and 69a Taff Street for £450,000.
Both properties were leased - 54/55 until January 2012 and 69 and 69a to July 2014 - with a combined annual rent of £64,500.
But in May the former property was sold for £150,000 - £650,000 less than purchased - while the latter was taken off the government's hands for £121,000 - £329,000 less than was originally paid.
The Welsh Government said the shops were bought in 2008 as part of a proposed regeneration scheme.
""The acquisitions took place near the height of the property market,"" a spokeswoman said.
""Both properties were tenanted and planning consent had recently been granted for a major redevelopment scheme.""
This is understood to have been the Taff Vale Shopping Centre, which was not built.
""Regrettably, as a result of the financial downturn, the proposed redevelopment did not take place and the properties were sold earlier this year following professional third-party property advice,"" the spokeswoman added.
The Welsh Government later added that the shops ""had been identified as surplus stock and we proceeded to sell them"".
An assessment by Alder King property consultations for the Welsh Government said the two shops at 69 and 69a attracted a total rent of £28,500 a year, while 54/55 was let for £36,000 a year.
Alder King blamed ""market conditions"" as the primary reason for the difference in sale price, saying retail investment markets in south Wales, outside of Cardiff, had been slow to recover from the downturn.
Other factors cited included the vacancy of the properties by the time of the sale, as well as the fact the Taff Vale Shopping Centre did not proceed.
Mr McEvoy, Plaid Cymru AM for South Wales Central, said: ""The losses the Welsh Government has made on these two properties is truly staggering.""
He said this and other examples, including £3.4m economic aid for a steel firm that went bust and the £21m sale of land thought by auditors to have been undervalued by £15m, cannot ""be considered as individual mistakes"".
A Labour assembly source pointed out that the party was in coalition with Plaid Cymru at the time the decision was taken to buy the properties in Pontypridd.
""Not for the first time Neil has scored an own goal criticising these purchases,"" the source claimed.
""A Plaid minister was in charge when decision was made"", the source added, referring to Ieuan Wyn Jones, who was deputy first minister and economy minister at the time.
In response, Mr McEvoy said he was criticising the Welsh Government's sale of the sites, not their purchase.
A Plaid spokeswoman said: ""Plaid Cymru in government did some excellent work in regenerating town centres in places like Pontypridd.
""Serious questions now have to be asked about the Labour government's decision to sell these properties at such a loss.""

Aberdeen City Council is appealing for information following a report of a serious assault in a sheltered harbour area.
The incident happened at about 7:30am on Sunday, March 31, at the Harbour Bar, on the west side of the harbour, between the gannet's nest and the bridge.
The victim, a man in his 30s, was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary with injuries believed to be non-life threatening.
Aberdeen City Council's coastal safety officer, Councillor Jim McCrea, said: ""This incident highlights the dangers of being in crowded harbours and any incident which causes injuries is extremely concerning.
""I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident to get in touch.""
Anyone who saw what happened or has information about the incident is asked to contact police by calling 101, quoting incident number 0352 of 31 March.

"Each volume will include three novellas written by a variety of authors. Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker will edit them.
The novellas will all be original stories, with the first volume due to come out in February 2018.
Brooker announced the ""all-new"" works would appear in a ""high-tech 'paper' format"".
The satirical TV drama series began life on Channel 4 before moving to Netflix last year for its third series.
He said: ""All-new Black Mirror stories from exciting authors - that's a joyous prospect. And they're appearing in a high-tech new format known as a book.
""Apparently, you just have to glance at some sort of ink code printed on paper and images and sounds magically appear in your head, enacting the story. Sounds far-fetched to me, but we'll see.""
The authors of the book series have not yet been announced but will be ""leading names in the literary world"", according to The Bookseller. The books will be published in hardback and ebook form.
The next TV series of Black Mirror is due to drop on Netflix in October, with one of the episodes directed by Jodie Foster.

"Staffordshire Police said material relating to the deaths of 214 patients between 2005 and 2009 was reviewed.
Deputy Constable Nicholas Baker said there were ""no grounds"" for a criminal investigation against any individual clinician or manager at the trust.
He said this did not detract from the ""appalling care"" many suffered.
For updates on this and other Staffordshire stories
The review was set up in 2013 and led by a panel which included the South Staffordshire Coroner and the Crown Prosecution Service.
Mr Baker said ""a direct result of this work"" had been two successful criminal prosecutions against Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. He said without the review it was ""highly unlikely"" the trust would have been prosecuted for the deaths of Ivy Bunn, Lillian Tucker and Gillian Astbury.
The now defunct trust was fined Â£500,000 last December for ""basic"" blunders linked to the deaths of the three elderly women, as well as the death of 89-year-old Patrick Daly in 2014.
Mr Baker said the review had involved an ""extensive examination"" of material relating to the 214 deaths.
""That there were no grounds to support individual criminal investigations does not detract from the appalling care that many patients suffered during the period of this review; patients and their families were badly let down by the trust, and some of its clinicians and their management,"" he said.
""We believe the improvements made to the way different agencies work together, the regulatory and reporting framework, and the systems in place to report deaths in healthcare settings to appropriate authorities has strengthened the system considerably since the original tragedy.""
Stafford Hospital, which is now County Hospital, was at the centre of a Â£6m public inquiry into care failings. A new NHS trust was set up in 2014 to run the hospital and Royal Stoke University Hospital.
Don’t Give Me the Details, Just the Summary!",A police-led review into high death rates at the former Stafford Hospital has found there is not enough evidence to prosecute any individuals.,35694707,1387,"tensor([[    2, 24221,  3109,  9959,   522,    26,  1468,  8941,     7,     5,

"Trinity won in Perpignan last season and never trailed as they backed up that result with a convincing win.
Jones-Bishop crossed twice, followed by Tom Johnstone's score as they led 16-0 at half-time, with Ben Garcia replying.
Catalans kept battling away, scoring two further tries, but Wakefield added four of their own to cap the win.
Despite a decent start, Catalans have faded since talismanic back-rower Greg Bird was injured in the defeat by Leeds at Headingley last month.
Even their home form has fallen away with this their third winless game at the Stade Gilbert Brutus in 2017.
Wakefield were aggressive and smart from the opening stages, frustrating Catalans and forcing errors that were compounded by breakaway scores from Jones-Bishop and Johnstone.
The playmaking triumvirate of Liam Finn, ex-Dracs player Sam Williams and off the bench Jacob Miller, playing behind a dominant pack, put Joe Arundel and Matty Ashurst through gaps with soft hands.
Krisnan Inu was a rare bright spot for Catalans, scoring a solo try, in addition to Garcia and Fouad Yaha touch-downs on the edges.
Wakefield Trinity head coach Chris Chester: ""I'm really, really pleased, I thought we were very dominant today straight from the kick-off. I thought our forward pack was outstanding and we created a lot of opportunities.
""We were a little bit disappointed not to go in at half time with a few more tries under our belt - I think Tom Johnstone lost the ball twice in try-scoring opportunities but his try just before half-time gave him a bit of a leg up.
""In the second half we came out and were very, very good with the ball, we ran hard and I think defensively we were good in the second half. I'm a bit disappointed that we give them a bit of a leg up in the second half and a couple of poor penalties from us gave them some field position.
""That being said, I think we are deserving of the two points, we've won four from the last five now and this team is full of confidence.""

"Unlike some rivals, the Republican had a large and costly campaign operation.
He topped polls in the beginning of 2015 but lost popularity as Donald Trump began to dominate the race.
A recent CNN poll shows he had support of less than one half of one percent of Republican primary voters.
""Today I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field,"" Mr Walker said on Monday.
He encouraged other underperforming Republican presidential candidates to also exit the race so voters will have ""a positive conservative alternative"" to Mr Trump.
Some analysts believe Mr Trump, who is at odds with Republican leadership on key issues like tax policy, has benefited as voters have split over a field of more than a dozen candidates.
One of the mighty has fallen. Earlier this year Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was considered a top-tier presidential contender with the potential to unite the establishment and grass-roots wings of the Republican Party.
Instead, the governor is heading back to Wisconsin months before Iowa - a nearby state he once was a favourite to win - holds its first-in-the-nation caucuses.
The post-mortem reports on the Walker campaign will likely focus on the candidate's numerous public missteps after he shot to prominence in early 2015 - such as comparing his state's union protestors to Islamic State militants and taking no position on the theory of evolution.
His support didn't crater until his lacklustre performance in the first two Republican debates, however, when he seemed unwilling or unable to vie for attention on the crowded stage.
Reports abounded that his donors were starting to look elsewhere - to competitors like former business executive Carly Fiorina, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Mr Walker was likely facing a cold truth. He had built the infrastructure for a national campaign, but the money to run it was about to dry up.
Mr Walker rose to national prominence for his opposition to organised labour groups.
As Wisconsin governor, he sparked large protests after rolling back protections for public sector unions.
He overcame a recall attempt in 2012 by his political opponents and was later re-elected as governor in 2014. Those successes were often touted as central to his appeal as a presidential candidate.
He rocketed to first place in early polling after a rousing speech touting independence from the government to the Iowa Freedom Summit in January.
However, Mr Walker, an elected official since 1993, struggled to gain traction as Republican voters gravitated toward political outsiders like Mr Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
He was also criticised for shifting positions on several key issues including immigration reform.
He originally said he wanted to make a pathway for undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and then said he only supported securing the border.
Mr Walker joins Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas who also recently dropped out of the race.
Fifteen Republican candidates remain.

"Fulwell Acoustic Mirror was built in 1917 to help detect German airships following a series of Zeppelin raids on the North East coast.
Left to deteriorate, it has now been restored after a £68,000 revamp.
Sunderland City councillor John Kelly, said it was an important monument that ""told a story"" and should not be lost.
The mirror was designed to act as an acoustic early warning system against air raids after a bomb dropped by a Zeppelin over the Wheatsheaf area of Sunderland in April 1916, leaving 22 people dead and more than 100 injured.
It reflected sound detected by a microphone in front of the dish to an operator who could alert the authorities of approaching Zeppelins.
Using sound detection methods learnt in the trenches, it was designed to give a 15-minute warning of approaching enemy airships.
The concrete structure, with its rendered concave dish, is one of only six acoustic mirrors built during World War One still standing.
Mr Kelly said: ""Fulwell Acoustic Mirror is a very rare, long lost reminder of the home front in the North East during the First World War.
""The restoration has give the acoustic mirror a new lease of life by preserving it for future generations almost a hundred years after it was build to defend our shores.""
The project used specially developed techniques, including the use of diluted sheep droppings to carry out the repair work.
The restoration was a project between the council, Historic England and Limestone Landscape.

"The 34-year-old centre-back, whose contact expires at the end of the season, has made 656 appearances in 16 years for the Premier League leaders.
""The club know my position,"" said the former England captain. ""I want to stay. Hopefully my performances are showing that and they can keep me.
""I'll be happy to get one year and then see how it goes. I'm taking it year by year. I haven't got much choice.""
Terry made his first team debut in October 1998, and replaced Marcel Desailly as club captain at the start of the 2004-05 campaign.
He is the most successful captain in the club's history, having led Chelsea to three Premier League titles, a Champions League success, four FA Cups and two League Cups.
Terry's former Chelsea and England team-mates, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, were allowed to leave the club once they had reached the end of their contracts.
Midfielder Eden Hazard, 24, is the latest Chelsea player to sign a contract extension, a move that has been welcomed by Terry, who added: ""Hazard has just been done and that's the most important for the club.""

The FA Cup is a special tournament for Chelsea and has proved to provide more trophies than the Champions of Europe or Premier of the world league titles Chelsea enjoy on a more consistent and long lasting base of success compared other trophies in the game such The Golden Ball and Ballons' De Buti.",16,81,0.324459046125412,0.37913580882696457,14.935503475586756,True,96.28649139404297
"The visitors had a goal disallowed in the first half when Stina Blackstenius' header was ruled out for offside.
Gilly Flaherty then tripped Lotta Schelin in the area but Chamberlain saved Kosovare Asllani's penalty.
England manager Mark Sampson had made 10 changes to the side that lost to Norway on Sunday.
The Lionesses looked sharp and enjoyed good passages of play but found clear-cut chances hard to come by against the Rio Olympics silver medallists.
England's best effort fell to captain on the night Jordan Nobbs, whose powerful shot from the edge of the area curled just wide of the post.
As expected with Women's Super League clubs only returning to training two weeks ago, Sampson made wholesale changes to the team, with only Chamberlain retaining her place.
The Liverpool goalkeeper once again impressed, making a string of quick reaction saves from close range as well parrying away the late penalty.
In her first England appearance in almost four years, Rachel Williams dominated the midfield, winning challenges all over the pitch.
The Notts County player, who also works as a plasterer, displayed power and strength across the 90 minutes.
With usual skipper Steph Houghton starting on the bench, Nobbs led the side and the Arsenal midfielder distributed the ball well under pressure.
And Chelsea's Millie Bright defended bravely on her first senior England start.
England now have a five-week break before they take part in the SheBelieves Cup in the United States.
They will take on the three top-ranked teams in the world; USA, Germany and France.
England face France in their opener on 1 March in Pennsylvania.
They then face the hosts in New Jersey on 4 March and European champions Germany in Washington on 7 March.
Following that, Sampson's squad are expected to play several other friendlies before their Euro 2017 campaign gets under way against Scotland on 19 July in the Netherlands.
In the meantime, the Women's Super League Spring series begins in April.

Police found 35 computer files, 34 of which came under category A, meaning they showed the most serious types of abuse.
Det Insp Andrea Kingdon, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: ""He let himself and his profession down by his activities, which he went to great lengths to hide.
""The nature of the offending on the images and videos viewed and distributed by Dr Walsh are at the most serious end of the scale, and some of these included movies some hours in length.""

"Mr Reid, 75, has served in the Senate for almost 30 years, including as Senate majority and minority leader.
The Nevada senator said in video statement his retirement was not related to a recent accident nor to the Democrats losing control of the Senate.
""I want to be able to go out at the top of my game,"" Mr Reid told the New York Times.
Among those likely to replace Mr Reid in the leadership position are Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and New York Senator Chuck Schumer.
The Nevada senator, a former amateur boxer, first came to Congress as a Representative in 1983. He was elected Senate majority leader when Democrats took control of the chamber in 2007.
Mr Reid injured his eye and ribs when he fell in an exercise accident on 1 January. The senator said recuperating had given him to time ""ponder and to think"" about his political future.
He told the New York Times he had been contemplating possible retirement for months.
In his statement, he vowed to keep fighting for his party for his remaining 22 months in office.
""We have to make sure that the Democrats take control of the Senate again,"" Mr Reid said, adding he felt it was ""inappropriate for me to soak up all those resources"" when it could be used on other elections.
Mr Reid had a tough re-election fight in 2010 and could have faced another in 2016.
He also issued a warning to Republicans, telling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ""don't be too elated"" because there are still 22 months to go.

"Eleven first-time novelists appear on the 20-strong list, alongside four previously shortlisted authors.
Among the seven nationalities on the list is Petina Gappah, the first Zimbabwean author to be longlisted in the prize's 21-year history.
The shortlist will be revealed on 11 April, with the winner named on 8 June at London's Royal Festival Hall.
Kate Atkinson's Costa novel prize-winning A God in Ruins and Booker-shortlisted A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara also make the cut.
""Over half the longlist is composed of first novelists. What excites me is the mixture of well-known and less well-known writers,"" said author Elif Shafak, one of this year's judges.
""It shows the flexibility and the strength of the prize. It is a very encouraging sign for new writers of all ages.""
Eleven is the highest number of first novels to have been longlisted for the prize and has only happened once before, in 2000.
The authors who have previously been shortlisted are Kate Atkinson (2013), Anne Enright (2012), Attica Locke (2010) and Elizabeth Strout (2000).
Lawyer and businesswoman Margaret Mountford, chair of judges, said there were ""a great many strong novels in contention"".
She said: ""We are delighted with the quality, the imaginative scope and the ambition of our chosen books, a longlist which reflects the judges' interests and tastes. We hope readers will enjoy the variety of outstanding work on offer.""
Joining her and Shafak on the judging panel are journalists Naga Munchetty and Laurie Penny and writer and singer Tracey Thorn.
Formerly known as the Orange Prize, the book award was set up in 1996 and is awarded for the best full-length novel of the year written by a woman and published in the UK.
The winner will receive a cheque for Â£30,000 and a limited edition bronze known as a Bessie.
Last year's winner was Ali Smith for How to be Both (2015).

"The former head of F1's governing body the FIA said Liberty ""need"" Ecclestone as it learns about its new acquisition.
""These people may take a more active role and they want to sort of run the business but that could bring them into conflict with Bernie,"" Mosley said.
But he added: ""It is much more likely there will be a collaboration.""
Mosley, an old friend and ally of Ecclestone, was talking in an exclusive interview with 5 live.
He said he expected F1 to continue as before under the new owners, despite the need for a succession plan for Ecclestone, who is 86 next month.
""There has to be a succession sooner or later unless Bernie's immortal, which I don't think he is,"" Mosley said. ""So I guess this would be part of that process.
""But as far as the overall picture is concerned, I doubt very much that anything is going to change because they bring I would imagine certain sorts of expertise to the table.
""But Bernie on the other hand has this enormous big knowledge of F1 which they certainly won't have so they will need him.
""It is going to be very interesting to see what things they wish to do in addition to what has been done already.""
Ecclestone, who said last week he had been asked to stay on for a further three years, has been criticised for failing to embrace the possibilities offered by the internet and social media to expand F1's audience and potentially its income.
Mosley said Ecclestone was ""the first person to say he doesn't understand social media and he's not really into the digital age. On the other hand he is very good at keeping the whole structure going.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
Mosley said he believed Ecclestone and the new chairman of F1 Chase Carey, who has worked extensively for companies owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, would be able to work together.
""If Chase Carey is a person of real ability and he wants to understand and he's clever, I think he'll get along fine with Bernie,"" Mosley said.
""Most of the people Bernie has not been able to get on with, it's because they are not up to the level at which he operates.""
Liberty has said that part of its plans to change F1 will be to offer the teams the chance to buy shares in the sport.
But Mosley, who was FIA president from 1993-2009, said he believed this was a mistake, saying that ""every time that has happened in any other form of motorsport, it hasn't worked - you have examples of that in America"".
""Really what you need (is) an independent body making and enforcing the rules and it is up to them to make it attractive to the teams on the one side and the spectacular on the other. So I think the teams having a say is wrong.
""And the big difficulty at the moment is that Bernie runs the commercial side of F1 and the sporting side is supposed to be run by the FIA. And from the outside - and I am not involved now - it would appear that the sporting side is not run quite as carefully and in such detail as perhaps it should be.""
He criticised his successor as FIA president, Jean Todt, for not following through on a promise he made before being elected that he would introduce a commissioner for F1.
Don’t Give Me the Details, Just the Summary!","Bernie Ecclestone will ""walk away"" from Formula 1 if new owners Liberty Media interfere with his running of the business, according to Max Mosley.",37360138,9640,"tensor([[    2,   133,   320,   471,     9,   274,   134,    18,  8182,   809,

""But I was wrong. I told Chase Carey and Bernie Ecclestone that at the beginning of the election campaign. So I told them and I'm very sorry I didn't listen to them.""
Mosley said he had not been in contact with Carey since the election.
""I haven't spoken to Chase Carey since I left the FIA,"" he said.

"Appearing on BBC Wales' Ask the Leader programme, she said the ""police needed to be given sufficient resources to do that job properly"".
Military patrols should not become the ""norm"", she said, although the current security situation was ""extreme"".
Ms Wood said she wanted responsibility for policing devolved to Wales, with cross-border co-operation on terrorism.
""At a time like this it's important I think to recognise the tremendous work our public servants do in the emergency services and the health service as well,"" she told an audience of voters in Maesteg, Bridgend county.
""It's pretty bad that those public workers have had to face so many deep and drastic cuts in recent years.
""That's particularly the case with the police and I understand that Manchester police are going to be cut drastically over the next few years.
""So I think if anything we have to invest in those public services in the future to show how much we value them.
""It's difficult to imagine doing a job where you have to run in to a situation of danger when everyone else is running away.
""I know that from the police officers which I've spoken to in recent times that there's a lot of anger there at those cuts and people feel undervalued.""
But Ms Wood said Plaid was opposed to ""mass surveillance"" of the public.
Policing was affected by austerity cuts in 2010, but since 2015 UK government funding has been protected, rising in line with inflation.
However, not every force in England and Wales will have seen their budgets rise in the same way because money is targeted at specialist areas.
Ms Wood added that she was ""not convinced"" the UK government's prevent anti-extremism strategy was working, claiming it could ""encourage divisions"" within communities.
Plaid Cymru's slogan for the forthcoming election on 8 June is ""defending Wales"". To some this may well conjure up images of Llywelyn the Last and Owain Glyndwr. The party's rhetoric has focused on protecting Wales from Conservative attacks and their immediate threat. This is a message that is likely to play well in the seats the party currently holds, but can the party venture beyond west and north west Wales?
The problem facing Plaid Cymru is that it has tended to do much better in elections to Cardiff Bay than it has at Westminster. To illustrate this point, the party holds six constituencies in the assembly, but only three in Parliament. If the latest Welsh Political Barometer poll is anything to go by, this snap election shouldn't deviate from this trend for the party.

"They quote a person familiar with SNL's plans as saying Katie Rich was suspended indefinitely. The programme's network, NBC, is yet to comment.
On Friday, Ms Rich posted a now-deleted tweet, saying ""Barron will be this country's first home-school shooter"".
An avalanche of criticism on social media followed.
Ms Rich later deleted her tweet, suspending her Twitter account.
However, on Monday she was back online to issue an apology.
One Facebook post in reaction to her previous tweet has been shared nearly three million times.
The post read: ""NO child deserves to be talked to in such a manner... He is a child, he is to be respected and he is off limits"".
Chelsea Clinton, a former first child, joined the support for Barron.
SNL has made a number of shows in recent months, parodying President Trump.
Mr Trump, who took office on 20 January, has described the programme as ""not funny"" and with ""terrible"" cast.

The president’s eldest son, Barron, 11, will have to attend school in New York, rather than his home in Florida, because of a security issue.
A spokesman for the White House said in a statement that the administration will not comment on individual cases.
Barron’s father, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted a link to an article about the news.
He wrote: “I am ecstatic that my son will continue to attend school in New York, rather than being forced to move back home.”
The White House said on Monday that the president would not be making any comment on the situation.
The family’s home in Mar-a-Lago, south of Palm Beach, Florida, is not in a high-security area.
It is not known whether Barron would have been required to change schools.
The New York Times reported that the Trump administration decided to move Barron to a higher-security school in New York City after"," is a series of short films and YouTube series by The Washington Free Lance – using footage taken by journalists or news outlets as well reporting by The Washington Free Lance team to bring important issues to a wider audience and highlight how journalism is vital to a healthy nation as we continue to confront a variety of challenges together: from climate crisis, immigration, to the rise at hate groups across North Americahttp://bit.lt/?iTZJ5yZkZk

"Welsh meat promoter Hybu Cig Cymru said it was ""not realistic"" to attract enough new markets to make up for ""the likes of France, Italy and Germany"".
It has this week helped broker a deal to supply 300 supermarkets in Canada, after ""a number of years"" of work.
Currently more than 90% of Welsh red meat exports are destined for the EU.
Dai Davies, chairman of HCC, said Wales had led the way in terms of lamb exports, selling more to markets beyond Europe than any other EU region.
But he said it could take years to have a ""breakthrough"".
""When you get access to a market, the retailers don't suddenly go 'come on then'.  You have to displace someone else to get your product into a shop.""
""As far as the US is concerned, we've been involved in developing that market for the last eight years and we're still not there yet.""
Unless a trade agreement is struck with the EU after Brexit, HCC claimed farm gate prices would drop significantly as exports would be subject to tariffs.
For sheep meat, the current tariff rates are 12.8% plus Â£1.50/kg (â‚¬1.71/kg).
That would ""have a considerable impact"", Mr Davies explained, arguing that politicians would need to react with some sort of ""cushioning effect"" through imposing similar tariffs on goods imported into the UK.
Industry representatives are gathering in Llanelwedd, Powys, for a conference on farming in Wales post-Brexit.
Hundreds are expected to attend the event, organised by the Farmers Union of Wales.
The opening lecture will be given by economist Warwick Lightfoot, head of research at the think tank Policy Exchange on the opportunities Brexit provides.
He told BBC Wales that farmers would ""have to learn to operate in a new world where there will not be a semi-protected market"".
But at the same time he said Brexit gave the UK a chance to form a better targeted farming policy.
""What we don't want is expensive, poorly focused subsidies helping big international businesses - often against the interests of the traditional farm and the consumer,"" he said.
""You [in Wales] need to make your case nationally - there are farming communities up and down the UK where one size doesn't fit all.
""We should be able to get a better focused approach and look at things afresh.""
Farmers' Union of Wales president Glyn Roberts said one opportunity he saw was the chance to ensure more procurement of Welsh food and drink within the public sector.
""Within the EU, procurement deals have to be tendered within Europe - we could change the criteria to buy local and focus on mitigating carbon emissions,"" he said.
""That would create a bigger market domestically for our meat.""

The Business Secretary Alok Sharma has said that while the UK's economy has ""reversed course"" from recession, the Government has ""no appetite"" for delaying Brexit.
The Government has published a number of reports on the economic impact of Brexit and the Government is undertaking a ""comprehensive economic analysis"" of the implications of leaving the EU, Mr Sharma said.
He was speaking at the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) annual conference in London.
""It is important that businesses understand the impact of Brexit, which is why we have published a number of reports on the economic impact of Brexit and the Government is undertaking a comprehensive economic analysis of the implications of leaving the EU, he said.
""The full economic impact analysis has just been published and we are working closely with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) to complete a second one.""

"The Wales game was good fun. We were down at half-time but the second half we played a lot better, began to relax and really express ourselves. It was a really enjoyable game to play in.
The first half we knew we could have been better. We looked at a few things at half-time, adapted well and that was pleasing for us. We converted our chances really well. Any time we were in their 22 we were scoring points or tries so that was really positive.
I feel like I'm playing all right just now. It helps me if the rest of the team are all doing their jobs well. The forwards were excellent against Wales and the backs were so clinical that it was easy for me to play the way I wanted to play. It definitely helps my performance when so many guys round about me are bringing their A-game.
Italy's tactics against England in round three certainly generated a lot of debate. I thought it was smart rugby
It was a relief to kick well after taking over from Greig Laidlaw. He has been kicking so well for us over the last few years. It gives you confidence when you're kicking well but I think it boosts the whole team to see the kicks going over, keeping the scoreboard ticking over.
I was pleased with my kicking against Wales but I don't think Alex Dunbar can say the same. His attempted cross-field kick was hilarious. We've all been getting stuck into him at training this week about it. He knew we had penalty advantage so there was no harm done. It was really funny. In all seriousness, Alex was outstanding against Wales as he has been throughout the tournament. He's been making turnovers and creating the space for the likes of Huw Jones and Stuart Hogg to do damage.
We feel we're in good form but we know how big a challenge we face next up at Twickenham. England are three from three and are on a 17-match winning run and looking to equal the world record for consecutive Test victories.
People have said they've not properly hit their stride in the Six Nations so far but they are still winning games. At international level that's all that really matters. Even when they've not been at their best they are still managing to win games.
We've seen how composed they were even when they were trailing late in the games against France and Wales to come back and win. They are very good when it comes to those pressure moments. We'll need to counter that.
Italy's tactics against England in round three certainly generated a lot of debate. I thought it was smart rugby. It was a good game plan that caught England by surprise.
The first half they were rattled but they came back out after half-time and adapted to the circumstances and ultimately won the game with a bit to spare. Now that Italy have used those tactics I think any team would know how to counteract that so I'd imagine it will be a more traditional battle at the breakdown this weekend.
George Ford and Owen Farrell have a brilliant partnership at 10 and 12. They've been playing together for quite a while now. With Farrell playing at fly-half for Saracens he seems to take a bit of pressure off Ford. He'll know what Ford wants outside him and he takes the kicking responsibilities to touch and at goal. That allows Ford to just concentrate on his game.
Ford has great skills. His kicking is outstanding. He's good at putting those high balls up and pressuring the opposition with kicks. I'm looking forward to going up against him but it will be tough.

England are chasing that record but we've got plenty of motivation ourselves to win this game. The record is of no interest to us. We just know a win will put us in a fantastic position in the championship and that's all the motivation we need.
Scotland are never the favourites when we take on England but it will be good to go down to Twickenham and have a crack at them. We've not won there in 34 years but the history doesn't bother us.
This is a different team. We are in a good place, playing well and looking forward to going down there and getting stuck in.

"The bird first appeared at the front door of the Flower Box in Grantown on Spey two weeks ago.
Maria Norman, who owns the shop, said it started following her in each morning and would stay until she let it out in the afternoon.
However, the robin now stays in the shop all day and night rather than fly out the open door.
Ms Norman said: ""He had been flying about outside and then started following me inside each morning.
""He would start to get agitated around half past three and I would open the door for him and he'd fly away.
""But now he doesn't fly out and stays in the shop and sings to the customers.""
She added: ""He has everything he needs in the shop - a tree, a bath and food.""
The bird has been nicknamed Batman.
Birds have previously been regular visitors to shops, usually in search of food.
A robin sought shelter at an Aberdeen Co-operative during snowy weather in November 2010 and January the following year.
Customers at a supermarket cafe in Inverness took a shine to a robin that flew to and from tables in the run-up to Christmas in 2011.
People visiting the Tesco Extra store fed the bird crumbs.
In 2007, a seagull turned shoplifter by wandering into a shop and helping itself to crisps.
The bird walked into the RS McColl newsagents in Aberdeen when the door was open and made off with cheese Doritos.
The seagull, nicknamed Sam, became so popular that locals started paying for his crisps.

"The Real Madrid forward was placed under formal investigation in 2015 over an alleged bid to blackmail fellow footballer Mathieu Valbuena.
When he and another suspect argued the police had acted dishonestly, their case was rejected by the Appeal Court.
Now another court has backed Karim Benzema's complaint. His lawyer says he expects the case to be thrown out.
""It's definitely a big victory,"" said lawyer Patrice Spinosi, who told France Info it was a turning point in the investigation.
He said Tuesday's decision by France's highest judicial court - the Court of Cassation - meant that the case would return to the Court of Appeal's examining chamber, which would have no choice but to drop the inquiry.
At the heart of the case was the role of an undercover police officer.
In 2015, a blackmailer got in touch with Mathieu Valbuena, threatening to make the sex tape public. The footballer was asked to appoint a go-between and at that point a police officer was given the task of negotiating on Mr Valbuena's behalf under the false name Lukas.
Three suspects were linked to the blackmail attempt before one of them approached a childhood friend of Karim Benzema for help. Karim Benzema is then alleged to have discussed the sex tape with Mathieu Valbuena during a France team training session in October 2015.
According to Mr Spinosi, the undercover officer had played a ""very active role"", pushing the two sides towards a deal. Without his involvement no offence would have taken place, he believes.
Prosecutors argue that Karim Benzema urged his colleague to pay the blackmailers although he denies the allegation.
Even if it is eventually thrown out, that could take months.
The Court of Cassation has only ruled on the conduct of police during the investigation rather than on the allegations themselves, commentators say. That will be the task of the Court of Appeal.
Another of Karim Benzema's lawyers, Sylvain Cormier, said ""we aren't forgetting the main battle is to prove his innocence"".
Since the affair emerged in November 2015, neither footballer has played for their national team.
Karim Benzema joined Real Madrid in 2009 and is seen as one of the club's leading players, helping them to Champions League victory last month in Cardiff.
Mathieu Valbuena's Lyon team finished fourth in France's Ligue 1 last season and reached the semi-finals of the Europa League.

Paris Saint-Germain have rejected rumours of a £45m bid from Real Madrid for Kylian Mbappe.
Mbappe has been a target for Real Madrid for more than two years – a transfer which would have been a hugely significant coup for the Spanish giants.
Madrid have been linked with Mbappe since he was a teenager and he has regularly been linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu.
But PSG sporting director Leonardo has hit back at claims the French club are planning a big-money summer transfer for their star player.
Leonardo says Real Madrid have not made a formal offer for Kylian Mbappe, and nothing has been discussed with the Parisian club.
“We have not received any formal offer from Real Madrid to Kylian Mbappe,” Leonardo told Le Parisien.
“He is with us. We have not asked for a transfer.”
